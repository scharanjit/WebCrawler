 release:update-version to release an aggregator project

Hi,

Let me give more information,

I use an aggregator project for war1 project:
    <modules>
        <module>../jar1</module>
        <module>../jar2</module>
        <module>../war-inc</module>
        <module>../war1</module>
    </modules>

Another aggregator project for war2 project:
    <modules>
        <module>../jar1</module>
        <module>../war-inc</module>
        <module>../war1</module>
    </modules>

Notice they both depend on jar1. The jar2 project in fact depends also on
jar1. The war-inc project is used to keep common web resources for war1 and
war2. We use maven overlay to marge those shared resources in a final war
for each project.

This is working like a charm. It has been working in fact now for 3 years.
However everytime we need a release we need to start updating version
unmbers in dependencies, doing prepare, then perform, you know the story.
This is great when the team releases every once in a while. This is an issue
if you want to release several times a day. About resources needed and so on
that is something we are tackling via idempotent scripts so we are literally
ready to make sure we increase the version number for all projects at once
every time new code is committed to the version control server. We can
handle that last part with jenkins, that is not a problem either. The only
problem is how can I leverage on an existing tool (without building it
myself) that would allow to release all modules from just one command.

So back to Roger suggestion I added the version override dependency as per
the github project, updated the version tag to point to 0.2.0 and run the
below command (including actually the very same example from github):
mvn clean install -Dversion.override=1.2.3-RC-5

However none of the modules were changed including no change to the
aggregator project either.

Roger, have you used this plugin with aggregator projects as I am trying?
Could you provide some further guidance?

My option is looking more and more like I will need to do something like:
foreach module
  replace module version
  for each dependency 
    if it is a module
      replace module version

Then find out if mvn:prepare and mvn:perform will work after from the
aggregator project releasing all necessary projects correctly. At this point
I am already facing another issue. Let us suppose I update my two war
multi-pom aggregator projects, all the modules and the dependencies to be
version 2.2000.0-SNAPSHOT.

I would expect a command line the below to change the version number in all
modules to 2.2000.0, tag it preparing it for release as well as setting the
next development version to be 2.2000.1-SNAPSHOT for all modules as well.
Finally each dependency that is a module itself should also be changed to
2.2000.1-SNAPSHOT. But that does not work either:
mvn clean --batch-mode release:prepare -DdryRun=true
-DautoVersionSubmodules=true -DreleaseVersion=2.2000.0
-DdevelopmentVersion=2.2000.1-SNAPSHOT

The resulting pom.xml.tag gets updated even dependencies but the
pom.xml.next gets updated (2.2000.1-SNAPSHOT) only for the version number of
each project, nor for the dependencies which do stay the same
(2.2000.0-SNAPSHOT). Will this be considered a bug?

I hope it is clear now what I need and also what the current issues are: Not
only versions:set and release:update-version do not work for
multipom-aggregator projects but in addition release:prepare together with
all the flags above which according to the documentation should be allowing
to fix a version for a release.

I guess an alternative question could be "how to provide continuous delivery
with multi-pom aggregator maven projects". To be honest I do not like the
idea of forcing all versions, it just looked the logical approach after we
decided we really did not care for internal versions, they could be handled
ideally automatically. However thinking twice about this I would like better
maven to accept a pattern to set part of the snapshot version number while
changing another part of it, for example with a mask:

-DversionNumberIncrementalMask=x.1.0

which would translate to:
Leave first digit as is
Increase by 1 second digit
set to zero third digit

Of course I would expect this to be applied to all snapshots.

Thanks for the answers so far,

- Nestor

How I want this to work is to have versions-maven-plugin have a way to undo
versions:resolve-ranges (
http://mojo.codehaus.org/versions-maven-plugin/resolve-ranges-mojo.html) -
it would need to ensure that the lower bound of any unresolved range is the
resolved version... [see below]

We'd need to split preparationGoals in the release plugin... either into
preparationGoals + verificationGoals or into initiationGoals +
preparationGoals (I favour the latter as it preserves the semantics of
preparationGoals... but the first one maps more correctly with what each
set should be doing)

Then this would become super easy...

You develop with version ranges for your dependencies...

The release plugin would have
    initiationGoals = versions:resolve-ranges versions:commit
    preparationGoals = clean verify
    completionGoals = versions:unresolve-ranges versions:commit

So say your development pom has

<dependency>
  ...
  <artifactId>foo</artifactId>
  <version>[1.0,2.0)</version>
</dependency>

and the latest version of foo is 1.2

When you kick off the release, the range gets resolved to

<dependency>
  ...
  <artifactId>foo</artifactId>
  <version>1.2<?versions range="[1.0,2.0)"?></version>
</dependency>

(My current thought is to use an XML PI to stash the old range)

Then we invoke Maven again (because Maven doesn't re-read the poms) and do
a "clean verify" to make sure that this all builds

Then we tag the release

Then we run completionGoals and versions:unresolve-ranges puts the version
range back, but upping the lower bound

<dependency>
  ...
  <artifactId>foo</artifactId>
  <version>[1.2,2.0)</version>
</dependency>

Maven ups the pom version to next development snapshot and commits the pom

That will give you the ability to develop on ranges (which is nice and
flexible) but release on pinned versions (which is exactly what you should
be doing)

If we cannot deliver something like that, then I think we should just drop
ranges from the next major version of Maven.

Subject: Re: continuous releasing: versions:set and/or release:update-version
 to release an aggregator project

I think this is perhaps related to problems I am seeing right now as well.

Basically, the versions:set goal is buggy except in the classic case
where the hierarchy of aggregation matches the hierarchy of
inheritance.

See
http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MVERSIONS-131
and
http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MVERSIONS-184

For example, given a tree:
A (pom only)
- B
- C (pom only)
- - D
- - E
where B and C are children of A
and D and E are children of C
and A aggregates B and C
and C aggregates D and E
In this case, versions:set plugin will work fine

Now consider adding a new root R which aggregates A, but is not the parent of A.
If you run versions:set on R it will only update R, and not A/B/C/D/E

If you manually set the version of A, and then run versions:set on R,
projects R/A/B/D/E will be updated, but not C. (which is pretty weird)

The patch in MVERSIONS-131 sounds reasonable. Could it be evaluated?

the correct way I see to handle this is to support wildcards in
versions:set, e.g.

mvn versions:set -DgroupId=* -DartifactId=* -DoldVersion=*
-DnewVersion=1.2-SNAPSHOT

which would therefore match not just the invoked project but all projects
in the reactor.

The changes in MVERSIONS-131 go against the original spirit of the goal
(namely you cd to the module you want to change and ask for it to be
changed... the effective reactor is grown and all references down-stream of
that module's version change are updated accordingly.

If C does not have a parent effected by the change you are making then C
should not be changed by versions:set (without wildcard support)

 From my point of view, this is not dependency, this is inclusion.

Assuming that :
jar1 and jar2 are independent projects
war-inc is common to all your war projects
war1 and war2 are to flavors of your project.

Each project/module should move at its own pace.

If war1 has a <dependency> on jar1, when war1 is updated, that person 
should check in your depot what is the most recent version and update 
accordingly.

You say it worked like a charm for 3 years. Maybe you had a problem that 
was invisible for 3 years and now becomes apparent because you are 
increasing the pace of releases.

My 2 cents.

Patrick

The problem is that as it currently stands, the plugin gives the
appearance of randomly choosing when to change versions. If you
consider the second example, the set goal changes R, A, B, D and E,
but not C, despite C being a child of A and in A's aggregator. Its
hard to not describe that as a bug.

Thus, I'm sure you can see the logic of what it is trying to do, but
as a user I just want it to change x to y wherever it sees it in the
whole aggregator build. If that needs a separate goal, then so be it.

I'm not sure how to proceed. The current plugin is useless for my
scenario without a separate script file to manually loop around the
structure. Its clearly useless for other people using aggregators.
You're wildcard suggestion might be an OK solution, but I'd have no
idea to implement it.

I simply want a goal that allows a multi-module build, where the
modules are versioned in lock-step, to be updated. Is that too much to
hope for?

first off versions:set is a @aggregator mojo. That means it only operates
on the -f specified pom file or the pom file in the working directory.

The goal is to update *that one project's version* it is not trying to
update other project versions.

So if you have

A
+B
|+C
|+D
+E
|+F
\G

where C and D inherits from B, F inherits from E and depends on C, A is an
aggregator with no parent-child relationship and G is a standalone project
that depends on F directly

Further we have in C

<project>
  <parent>
    ...
    <artifactId>B</artifactId>
    <version>2.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
  </parent>
  <artifactId>C</artifactId>
  <!-- no version tag -->
</project>

and in D

<project>
  <parent>
    ...
    <artifactId>B</artifactId>
    <version>2.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
  </parent>
  <artifactId>D</artifactId>
  <version>2.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
</project>

from the root of the project you type

$ mvn versions:set -f B/pom.xml -DnewVersion=2.2-SNAPSHOT

What happens is that the goal's groupId defaults (as no property was set)
to the groupId of B, the artifactId defaults to the artifactId of B, the
oldVersion defaults to the current version of B and the plugin starts
building up its list of changes.

Initial list:

1. B:2.1-SNAPSHOT -> B:2.2-SNAPSHOT

Now it starts looking to see if it can grow the effective reactor... the
parent directory has a pom and the pom has <module>B</module> so it can
grow the effective reactor adding A and all the modules referenced by A
into it's list of poms to check. In A's parent directory there is no pom
with a <module>A</module> so it stops growing the reactor. It now has the
following list of poms to check:

A,B,C,D,E,F,G

It looks to see what the effect of changing B's version is on that set of
poms....

A -> no change
B -> no new changes
C -> inherits version from parent => add C to list of changes and start
again

List of changes:

1. B:2.1-SNAPSHOT -> B:2.2-SNAPSHOT
2. C:2.1-SNAPSHOT -> C:2.2-SNAPSHOT

A -> no change
B -> no new changes
C -> no new changes
D -> parent changes, but D also explicitly sets version -> leave D's
version unchanged
E -> no change
F -> dependency on C has changed -> update dependency
G -> no change

The list of changes has not been mutated this time, so we now have the
complete final models to apply

Then the poms get updated.

So if you start with everything at 2.1-SNAPSHOT, you will end up with

A:2.1-SNAPSHOT
B:2.2-SNAPSHOT
C:2.2-SNAPSHOT
D:2.1-SNAPSHOT
E:2.1-SNAPSHOT
F:2.1-SNAPSHOT
G:2.1-SNAPSHOT

*and* the reactor maintains its intra module reationships as the
dependencies have been updated.

If you want to achieve the same result without the -f or changing working
directory, you can tell it the groupId and artifactId of the change to
make, e.g.

$ mvn -DgroupId=... -DartifactId=B -DoldVersion=2.2-SNAPSHOT
-DnewVersion=2.1-SNAPSHOT

from the directory with A in it will undo all those changes

If I understand this correctly, goal is to release 2 wars, which have some
jars and some wars in common. And, everything is part of the same
multi-module-maven-project.
That would be sth like:

-pom (all versions are defined only here)
 |- jar1
 |- jar2 (depends on  jar1)
 |- war-inc
 |- war A (depends on jar1 and overlays war-inc)
 |- war B (depends on jar2 and overlays war-inc)

With such structure and if you're using maven release plugin, both warA and
warB will be versioned automatically with each release.

My approach is to always release the whole project on the main pom level.
If I need to move from my version 1.2.07 to 1.3.00, I just find and replace
through the whole project current -SNAPSHOT into 1.3.00-SNAPSHOT (which is
defined only in version for the pom and in the parent/version of module
poms).

Thanks for the detailed description, which I hope your making a web page out of.

Here is the current description "Sets the current projects version,
updating the details of any child modules as necessary." From that I
conclude it will set the current project version and any child modules
necessary to make it all match.

It also says "The set goal can be used to update the version of the
current module. It will automatically climb up local directories to
find the aggregation root. It will automatically update explicitly
referenced dependencies"

Again, the expectation is that it will correctly set all the versions
I want it to set. From oldVersion to newVersion.

Basically, it seems to be being too clever for its own good.

As it is, even a batch script cnanot achieve my goal. I have projects like this:

A
B
C
- D
- E
F

where A and B are children of C, but not within the aggregator of C
(unlike D and E which are children and are within the aggregator). I
have a separate overall aggregator R that runs A, B and C.

If I set the version of C, and then try to set the version of A or B,
the plugin fails with "Project version is inherited from parent".

So, I get that I'm trying to use the plugin for something you didn't
intend, but there isn't an alternative here that does do what I want,
right?

So, we really need a new goal - versions:set-aggregated - which sets
every matching version within an aggregated pom structure when called
from the root.

Would you want such a thing included in the versions plugin? Or does
it need to be a separate plugin?

I have to have something, as the alternative is stupid amounts of manual work.

Stephen

Subject: Re: continuous releasing: versions:set and/or release:update-version
 to release an aggregator project

I pulled svn and tried it, and it didn't work in my case. It didn't
even set the root aggregator pom.

My set-aggregated goal is here and does work:
https://gist.github.com/jodastephen/6133391

Unfortunately, half my test project is private so its hard to
describe/publish logs.

Yeah I need to write some tests...

You did use wildcards by the way? ie

$ mvn versions:set -DgroupId=\* -DartifactId=\* -DoldVersion=\*
-Dversion=...

Keep in mind you need to escape the wildcard appropriate for your shell or
it will replace with a glob that can never match

No, I didn't use the wildcards (they are very unatural UI for solving
what seems like a normal case)

With wildcards I got NPE:

This is exactly what I needed a couple of weeks ago. I came up with the
same procedure but discovered that the versions plugin doesn't support
unresolving ranges. Is this something that's in the works or it's just
something you wish  were there?

Subject:	Re: continuous releasing: versions:set and/or
            release:update-version to release an aggregator project



How I want this to work is to have versions-maven-plugin have a way to undo
versions:resolve-ranges (
http://mojo.codehaus.org/versions-maven-plugin/resolve-ranges-mojo.html) -
it would need to ensure that the lower bound of any unresolved range is the
resolved version... [see below]

We'd need to split preparationGoals in the release plugin... either into
preparationGoals + verificationGoals or into initiationGoals +
preparationGoals (I favour the latter as it preserves the semantics of
preparationGoals... but the first one maps more correctly with what each
set should be doing)

Then this would become super easy...

You develop with version ranges for your dependencies...

The release plugin would have
    initiationGoals = versions:resolve-ranges versions:commit
    preparationGoals = clean verify
    completionGoals = versions:unresolve-ranges versions:commit

So say your development pom has

<dependency>
  ...
  <artifactId>foo</artifactId>
  <version>[1.0,2.0)</version>
</dependency>

and the latest version of foo is 1.2

When you kick off the release, the range gets resolved to

<dependency>
  ...
  <artifactId>foo</artifactId>
  <version>1.2<?versions range="[1.0,2.0)"?></version>
</dependency>

(My current thought is to use an XML PI to stash the old range)

Then we invoke Maven again (because Maven doesn't re-read the poms) and do
a "clean verify" to make sure that this all builds

Then we tag the release

Then we run completionGoals and versions:unresolve-ranges puts the version
range back, but upping the lower bound

<dependency>
  ...
  <artifactId>foo</artifactId>
  <version>[1.2,2.0)</version>
</dependency>

Maven ups the pom version to next development snapshot and commits the pom

That will give you the ability to develop on ranges (which is nice and
flexible) but release on pinned versions (which is exactly what you should
be doing)

If we cannot deliver something like that, then I think we should just drop
ranges from the next major version of Maven.

If you read MNG-3092 (it is long!), you'll see this is not currently possible.

It is something I have been trying to figure out a nice way to do for the
past 2-3 years... It's never a high enough priority for me though as I just
update the poms and move on.

The first blocker is identifying if xml pi is preserved by the rewrite that
the release plugin does during prepare... If that isn't preserved we need
to fall back to "magic" comments which is sub- optimal to say the least

Subject: Maven war has META-INF folder in two places
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
X-Virus-Checked: Checked by ClamAV on apache.org

Hello,

I'm working on a project which uses JAAS and unfortunately for me Tomcat 
requires a file to be put in a META-INF folder in the root of the war

app.war
   |__META-INF
   |    |___context.xml
  ...

I think that it's already weird since the default META-INF location for 
WAR's is in the classes folders.

app.war
   |__WEB-INF
   |    |__classes
   |         |__META-INF
  ...

I'm using Maven, which states that anything in 
src/main/resources/META-INF will be copied to the appropriate place, 
which it does. What I'm trying to figure is whu it is also creating a 
META-INF folder in the root of the file structure leaving me with 2 
META-INF folders.

Project Structure

app
   |__src/main/java
   |__src/main/resources
   |       |__META-INF
   |             |__context.xml
  ...

After mvn package

  app
   |__META-INF [1]
   |__WEB-INF
   |     |__classes
   |           |__META-INF [2]
   |                  |__context.xml
  ...

So, if the war standard states that META-INF should be under classes 
folder, as in #2, why maven war creates the #1 folder. And is there a 
way to make it copy files into that folder instead of #2?

Regards

There is a quirks here:

JAR: META-INF always goes into src/main/resources
WAR: META-INF always goes into src/main/webapp

There is no WAR META-INF in the classpath but in the ServletContext=20
ResourceLoaderPath only.

I think John C raises an interesting case here, where the voting process
can fall down.

A large code dump like that can hurt the quality of documentation and
support (in addition to team morale).

My $.02

Fixed in r18607 and I've redeployed a 2.2-SNAPSHOT

I now have test cases and I have verified that there are no regressions.

Just have to decide if there is anything else I will add before cutting a
release

I'll try and test it tomorrow.

However, I'd encourage you to take a step back and think if the use of
three extra arguments to the plugin, which is primarily intended for
command line use, is a pleasant UI. I'd also encourage you to consider
whether updating a single GAV wherever it is found is really the same
concept as updating a tree (potentially with filtering to reduce its
scope).

Using
 mvn versions:set-aggregated
is a lot more pleasant than
 mvn versions:set -DgroupId=* -DartifactId=* -Dversion=*
particularly when the use cases are pretty different.

I don't think I'm asking to throw away today's changes, just to
repackage them in a more friendly way.

Stephen

If you are going to do it on a regular basis you either script it or set up
a profile for doing it and then it's just

$ mvn -Pupdate-versions -DnewVersion=2.1-SNAPSHOT

Or if you want to have the profile auto-activated

$ mvn -Dupdated.version=2.1-SNAPSHOT

Where the profile has a defaultGoal of `validate` and you bind
`versions:set` to that phase and inject all the configured wildcards and
inject newVersion as ${updated.version}

That gives you a very error-proof repeated process.

The use of wildcard-like behaviour is not a good plan, so being slightly
more cumbersome on the CLI is a bonus from my PoV.

I prefer to encourage best practice by making non-best practice harder...
Making it impossible is not a good idea IMHO.

I'm trying to argue that that your perception of it being bad practice
is out of place. It is very common for teams to want to have a tree of
modules that are all versioned together with a single version number.
It is your implementation choice to make it wildcarded. What I, and
others, need is to simply replace all matching versions in a single
aggregated reactor with a new version. While these two approaches may
seem similar, I humbly suggest that they are conceptually different.

It depends on how good the code and documentation is!
If the PMC can not deal with the amount of code being proposed, they 
need to increase the PMC.
In the meantime, they can always defer the acceptance.

I would love to have the problem of my team producing too much tested 
code and documentation for me to read!!!

That's the point, not really talking of "your team" here. The (somehow a
bit hypothetic, granted) point raised here is where you would find yourself
in front of say one year of coding being proposed. And IIUC, we're only
talking about *PMC members* and values here. Sure, one company/individual
could work on his fork and propose a lot of changes later when he finally
wants/is allowed to, and btw he hasn't any direct commit access to the
project and so on.

 About growing the PMC, I suppose we're looping here ;-). IIUC, again, I
think the point is precisely to define those values/rules to be able to
induct more serenely new PMC members while asking them to adhere to those
definitions.

Cheers

It will be harder to say yes to the new code and the coder may find that 
he/she has to do a lot of rework to resynchronize with the current base 
but you are still getting enhancements that otherwise would not be done.
The coder is always free to make a fork and continue with a "better" 
product if the work submitted is not acceptable to the PMC or the PMC 
becomes moribund.
I think that this is the normal way to handle this.
Obviously, if the PMC can not keep up with a group of coders that are 
pursuing an aggressive vision of Maven enhancements, this may cause the 
PMC to become an unacceptable bottleneck and the fork will become the 
most active version and may start to attract more of the community.

I think that, so far, this idea has not found much favour with the 
broader community.
I am not sure how you get someone to promise not to undertake 
enhancements that result in too much code or add too much functionality.

The actual wording of the proposed litmus test only indirectly addressed 
this and seemed to be an attempt to codify a personality conflict with 
rules that would hurt the long-term viability of the project by 
replacing innovation with the group-think of an inner clique.
It also seemed to go against the principle of open source.
At least, that was the way it appeared to me as a community member 
outside the PMC.

Then they all should have a common parent and use parent version
inheritance.

If the version number is supposed to be the same, then you use inheritance
from the root and versions:set takes care of it all for you.

If the version number is not supposed to be the same, then versions set
does exactly what you want also, allowing you to carve version number
increments through the entire tree for those portions which are supposed to
be the same.

It is your implementation choice to make it wildcarded. What I, and

Hi Nestor

The version.override feature is not a plugin it's an extension to the maven
base installation. So,
http://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails|ch.rotscher.maven.core|maven-core-extensions|0.2.0|jarhas
to be installed to your
*MAVEN_HOME/lib/ext*.

The extension is then activated with *-Dversion.override* on the command
line. It changes the version on the fly but only for the current build and
without changing the pom file. There are several strategies on how the
version is "generated".

Beware, that the groupId of the root pom is taken into account whether the
version of a module or dependency should be changed to ${version.override}.
E.g. groupId is *com.foo.bar* then all modules/dependencies with
com.foo.bar and com.foo.bar.* are included. In other words the extension
assumes all modules/dependencies with the same base groupId to be in the
same reactor.

Cheers,
Rotsch

At the moment, the words themselves are meaningless (as they are still
up for debate - and why this thread was created, so that they could be
crafted by the community).

Once there is some consensus they will be used in the future.

They do. But its never that simple. Some of the child modules are
public and some are private (of the same public parent). Since the
names of the private ones cannot be exposed in the public area, we
have a separate private aggregator to pull the private and public into
the same reactor where everything works fine.


I have tested the changes, and they replicate the set-aggregated goal
I wrote. I still think a separate goal is clearer to document and use,
but its your plugin. I think you're going to need quite a lot of
documentation to describe what the plugin is supposed to do. For
example, for my use case, only the artifactId needs to be wildcarded.

There is one area where the plugin does not update (nor did set-aggregated):
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.opengamma.platform</groupId>
      <artifactId>og-integration</artifactId>
      <version>${og.version}</version>
    </dependency>

Because it is a property, it is not updated. I think this is a separate issue.

Thanks for working on this. Once released it will work effectively
enough for us, with just the one manual ${og.version} property change.

Author: stephenc

New Revision: 1509594

URL: http://svn.apache.org/r1509594
Log:
After a lengthy discussion on the users@maven list and some
side discussions on members@apache, I think the following changes
are more in line with what we should be seeking as responsibilities
of the PMC.

* Forks are not bad... letting changes stack up in the fork is bad
  but more from a 'it will be hard to review' point of view...
  similarly using a fork to get external contributions complicates
  the tracablity

* We are not obligated to promote other ASF projects... but there
  should be a symmetry in how that lack of obligation plays out

* I identified some more responsibilities of the PMC (if I have missed
  any, please add)

* There is a special case where the PMC Chair can wear the dictators
  hat... but that is only in the case of unresolvable consensus
  and the lack of consensus is causing damage to the project
  and the board is well aware of the issue and expects the chair
  to put on the dictators hat (with the board watching on)

As always, this is a Commit Then Review community... so these
changes are being committed for review.

 #### Standards for Community Commitment

@@ -186,22 +206,77 @@ In the spirit of supporting the health o
 Management Committee members refrain from actions that subvert the
 functioning of the committee itself.

-First, Project Management Committee members should not maintain
long-running
-forks of Maven code outside of the project itself. Making significant
-changes to Maven code outside of the project displays a lack of
-investment in the community. Additionally, attempting to re-integrate
-a large number of code changes in bulk overwhelms the ability of
-volunteers in the community to review (and potentially veto) the
-changes. This effectively thwarts the policing function of the
-PMC.
-
-Second, Project Management Committee members should not divert
-work on redesigning, reimplementing, or improving Maven code to
-alternative projects outside of this community for the purposes of
-reintroducing them as replacement for existing Maven code. While there
-is a danger here of falling into a Not Invented Here mentality, new
projects
-created by Maven PMC members strictly to replace Maven code should not be
-allowed.
+#### Promotion of other projects
+
+The Apache Foundation currently does not have a policy requiring projects
to
+cross-promote. For example Subversion is an Apache project, yet projects
+are free to choose from Subversion and GIT (a non-Apache project) for
source
+control.
+
+When considering integration of technologies within Maven, there is
+thus no requirement that other Apache projects be picked over non-Apache
projects.
+
+The primary requirements for picking technologies to integrate with Maven
+are thus:
+
+* A compatible license, i.e. Category A or Category B
+* A good technical fit
+* A strong preference on behalf of the portion of the community that
+  will be doing the integration.
+
+Where a PMC member is advocating a specific technology, they should declare
+any interest / involvement that they have in that technology or a competing
+technology - irrespective of whether the project is an Apache project or a
+project hosted elsewhere.
+
+PMC members with a stated interest / involvement should try to abstain from
+making binding votes in either direction with respect to the relevant
+technology choices.
+
+#### Forks of the project codebase
+
+All code that gets released by the community should have sufficient
opertunity
+for review both:
+
+* By the PMC, to check the legal responsibilities delegated by
+  the Board; and
+* By the committers (which includes the PMC), to check that the technical
+  direction and quality is in line with the consensus roadmap.
+
+It is self evident that the opertunity for review is much greater if the
code
+is committed to the project's source control as early as possible.
Similarly
+small commits are easier to review than large commits.
+
+There is nothing inherently wrong with maintaining a fork of the Maven
+codebase outside of the Apache Foundation. Individual developers can have
+their own style of working and may prefer to work in a fork so that they
+can throw away failed experiments with less visibility (though it could be
+argued that the visibility of such failed experiments can be valuable
+documentation for others). As soon as changes in that
+fork are identified which should be brought back to the project those
+changes should be introduced into at least a branch hosted on the Apache
Maven
+source control in order to facilitate the easier review by the community.
+
+The PMC should encourage by example the early committing of changes from a
+fork back to Apache Maven source control.
+
+Similarly, if a fork is being hosted elsewhere in order to get
contributions
+from other talented individuals, the PMC members should endevour to bring
+those individuals and their tallent to the project as committers.
+
+Finally, where a fork is hosted outside of Apache hardware, there is less
+traceability of the code provenance, for example GIT commits can be
squashed
+and history re-written to mask or otherwise hide the source of
contributions.
+This does not mean that code coming from an external fork inherently has
+such issues, instead it means that the requirements for review and
verification
+of provenance grow exponentially when dealing with large sets of changes
+originating from a long running fork hosted outside of Apache foundation
+source control. Anybody maintaining a long running fork should be aware
+of the risk that review obligations may grow above the time capabilities
+of the PMC and committers such that when they eventually decide to try and
+bring the changes in their fork back to the Apache Maven project their
+contribution may end up being rejected on the basis of the review of a
+large set of changes being too difficult/timeconsuming.

@Patrick, Thanks for your reply. It has worked like a charm for three years
because the team has not done continuous delivery/deployment. Now it is the
time to change that and so the need is genuine: To release everything fixing
version numbers on the fly with just one command that can be automated in a
CI server.

@Stephen, correct. It works only for inheritance. Not for pure aggregation.

Hello,

I'm using assembly plugin to get dir and pack it into tar.gz
I'm using pretty simple config made from examples on assembly plugin site. Using my own descriptor which put all project artifacts (jars) and their deps to lib/ directory.
Now if I do
   mvn clean package
I get project jars in lib dir in format artifact-name-SNAPSHOT.jar

If I do
   mvn clean deploy
I get jars in format artifact-name-SNAPSHOT.jar + same jars in format artifact-name-$TIMESTAMP.jar
where TIMESTAMP is usuall mvn deploy timestamp.
So problem is that in deploy case I get same jars twice but with different names.
Does anyone knows how to fix this ?
Thanks in advance.

I think the bulk of this is pretty good. On the fork section, specifically:

"
As soon as changes in that
fork are identified which should be brought back to the project those
changes should be introduced into at least a branch hosted on the Apache Maven
source control in order to facilitate the easier review by the community.

The PMC should encourage by example the early committing of changes from a
fork back to Apache Maven source control.
"

This seems to want to compel code to be brought back as a
responsibility, I don't think we need to spell that out. The section
about the downsides to not doing so and attempting to do it later is
really the core of the concerns... the extra diligence required to
consume large bodies of work is bigger. That doesn't mean that code
contributions are inherently bad just because they were developed
elsewhere, it's just harder to pull in.

Big thumbs up to all your changes. Nice work.

Some brief comments from a technical perspective:

> possible. Similarly small commits are easier to review than large
> commits.

Technologies like GitHub and Gerrit are making code review extremely easy
these days. I am not sure what tools Apache projects use for code review,
but in the interest of facilitating such review, I definitely believe that
going with the best available *technical* option(s) makes sense, regardless
of whether the tool itself is an Apache project. Use what works.

The old text said: "there is a danger here of falling into a Not Invented
Here mentality" and I couldn't agree more. The new language is much better,
which clearly warns of the consequences of long-running forks while also
stating that they may sometimes be useful and/or appropriate.

> GIT commits can be squashed and history re-written to mask or
> otherwise hide the source of contributions.

True, and it is good to warn about this. However, ultimately I think Git is
a better choice (than SVN) because it often makes code review much easier.
If a new feature is properly developed on a topic branch with commits
squashed, rewritten and organized as needed, the history can be laid out in
a very easy-to-understand manner: new features and bugfixes done in
properly isolated commits, unit tests added immediately thereafter, etc. If
a commit is too large or conflates many different changes, Git provides the
tools to split up that work for rereview.

Again, thanks for writing this. The new words give me more confidence that
Apache has the community's best interest at heart, rather than only "Apache
for Apache's sake."

Regards,
Curtis

P.S. For those interested, Stephen's changes are more clear when reading

This is why I say "as soon as ... are identified"

The wording could be clearer... if somebody can figure out a better way to
say it.

Basically, as soon as you say something like... "Oh commit 1a2b3d4e, we
really need to get that into Maven itself, it's too good to be in our
fork"... you should be trying to hasten getting that commit into Maven
itself.... and if you are on the PMC and one of your commits is one that
you say this of... you should just commit it back.

Until you realise that a commit is one that you want to push to Maven, hey
it's your work... whatever... but as soon as you identify the change as
being one that should be at Maven, as a PMC member you are expected to try
and get it into Maven quickly so that others working on the fork see that
this is the example by which the PMC leads.

If you can think of a clearer way to express that than my wording (which
since you are not getting my intended meaning must therefore be lacking)
please update.

Unfortunately the review must be of what lands at Apache servers. It could
be a bare bones review because the bulk of the review happened elsewhere,
but there must still be eyes on the code when it lands at Apache.... at
least that is my understanding.

SVN history can be rewritten if you have admin access to the Subversion
server... SVN revision properties can be edited to, e.g. change author or
commit message, etc.

This is not just a GIT issue, this is a "not happening at Apache hardware"
issue... when it happens at Apache hardware, we can be more lax about
probing for those kind of issues as we have the excuse that we rely on
infra to put in place the controls to ensure the required traceability...
when it happens on 3rd party controlled hardware, we don't have that
option, so the review needs to be more strict.

Yes, and I don't think anyone was suggesting we move away from GIT... if
anything we are migrating our repositories from Subversion to GIT because
it is the better tool.

Keep in mind that there will always be some things that we need to do in
slightly strange ways because we need to maintain the legal protection that
the foundation provides for Committers... but keep in mind that none of us
enjoy that!!!

Furthermore, I'd like to see explicit procedural rules on Maven Core and
forking. For example, if there's a critical component needing development
for Core, and a PMC expresses that such development will be done outside of
Apache and then used as a dependency, shouldn't there be a vote on that?

Votes should be a tool to confirm consensus... not an iron hand.

If the consensus of the developers is to use the dependency which is
external to the project, then that is fine. If there is no consensus then
the dependency will not be introduced.

We already have a policy that adding Category B dependencies to Core
requires approval of the PMC, I don't see that there is much value in
adding even more to this document... but if you can suggest a patch and
people agree with it...

Hi Paul,

> then used as a dependency, shouldn't there be a vote on that?

Wouldn't there be a vote for the adoption of any dependency, anyway? Or at
least a code review process on the changes that bring in that dependency...?

Regards,
Curtis

I didn't use gerrit nor have seen anybody using it. But I hear about it=

Is this pure theory? a dream? a reality for a minority of experts, talk=

(intentional provocational tone to motivate people who know to show me =

yes, with git, you can: with git, so much things can be done.
But once again, I didn't see anybody do it, because it's a lot of work.=

And it requires to be a git black belt.
For the moment, just making a rebase before merging a branch seems hard=

I don't understand the iron hand analogy. I was expressing the use of a
vote to allow or disallow critical development outside of Apache. The vote
would lead to a consensus, no?

I have a large, multi-module project that includes WAR and EAR projects. 
We are using skinny WARs inside the EAR.

I'm seeing a problem where the WAR manifest has timestamped classpath 
entries (e,g, research-jpa-1.0.0-20130802.111122-177.jar) but the EAR 
contains SNAPSHOT files (e.g. research-jpa-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar).

This only appears to happen if the dependencies (research-jpa in this 
example) are retrieved from the remote repo. The problem goes away if I 
"mvn install" the research-jpa project before building the WAR project.

Is there a work-around for this problem? Is it a known issue or should I 
open a JIRA for it? If I should open one, would it be against the WAR 
plugin or the archiver?

If it matters we're using Maven 3.0.5, war-plugin 2.4, ear-plugin 2.8

We cannot stop somebody from developing something outside of Apache.

So I could go off and write a High Performance Logging API... now I could
be doing that because I want to foist that Logging API on Maven... or I
could be doing it as an experiment that, if successful, I may offer for
Maven to consume... or I could be doing it because I need it for my Day
Job...

We cannot know the reasons why somebody is doing something outside of
Maven... we can ask, but we cannot *know* if the answer we are given is
truthful.

So anyway, I now have this ultra whizzbang high performance logging API and
I am aware of some deficit in the logging performance of Maven, so I spin
up a private fork (it could be a hidden private fork, or it could be a
public one... doesn't matter) and integrate the logging API and low and
behold I see a whopping X% improvement... so I want to bring that back to
Maven...

Is there anything wrong with the above?

If the library I created is under a Category A license and open source and
I go with CTR and nobody vetos my commit... we have consensus... why do we
need to go all Iron Fist and require a vote?

We already have established tools: review of commits, vetos on commits,
mandatory votes for Category B dependencies...

Do we really need *more* processes and procedures to follow?

Google uses it (of course). For example, for Chromium:
https://gerrit.chromium.org/
Kitware uses it. ITK, VTK, etc.: http://review.source.kitware.com/
I'm sure there are many others.

Personally my colleagues and I don't use it; we use GitHub's code review
mechanism which is simple and effective. You can comment on any Pull
Request, and on any line of any commit.

> I hear about it more and more often as an argument why it makes git

It was not my goal to argue that "Gerrit makes Git better than SVN" but
rather than good code review tools make code review *much* easier.

Git is better than SVN for many, many reasons that have nothing to do with
code review tools. :-P

As a programmer, revision control in one of your bread-and-butter tools.
Shouldn't you be taking the time to become a VCS black belt? Doing so will
save you loads of time in the long run, for the same reasons that becoming
a command line master, or an IDE master, or a master of *any* effective
productivity tool, will. Embrace Larry Wall's virtues of the programmer --
laziness, impatience and hubris -- and always seek the better, faster path!
Computers are different than other skill sets: a professional sprinter may
be able to sprint 2x or 3x or even 5x faster than you, but a professional
programmer can accomplish a task on a computer thousands or even millions
of times faster than a neophyte... *if* the programmer has a thirst for
knowledge and self-improvement.

</soapbox>

Anyway, yes, my colleagues and I *do* use Git in this way: work on topic
branches, rewrite history to make review easier, and sometimes file Pull
Requests on GitHub to specifically invite review for possibly disruptive
changes.

I'm not really sure what to point you at here, other than the "Contribution
Activity" section of my GitHub page:
https://github.com/ctrueden
Of course, it is changing all the time...

Regards,
Curtis

 I say absolutely not. Where things can go wrong is what happens next.
If someone commits that giant chunk with no discussion, then that's
probably going to raise concerns. If instead a discussion is started
to discuss the work and decide if it's appropriate to pull in, then
fine.

I've stated from the beginning of this thread that it's impossible to
prevent someone from developing outside of Apache. I stand by that still.
That can't be prevented and any attempt will fail since it's not practical.

If my words today aren't clear, I'll try again. My stance isn't about
halting developing elsewhere, but to halt what I (and maybe some others)
perceive as a way of getting around the Apache community.

I won't use your "ultra whizzbang high performance logging" :-) example
because it doesn't fit what my concern; but imagine an existing component
(I won't name any) that is critical and Maven's existence and Maven can't
function without it. It's very easy for any PMC member to go to another OSS
community, develop it, and then kind of leave the other PMCs with no real
"choice" but to use it because the code realizes the future of Maven. Those
other PMCs are really backed into a corner; they have no real recourse to
preventing this, lest Maven development is simply halted altogether. The
other OSS community has other committers, other mailing lists, other
deliberations, etc. Community work and input becomes marginalized here.

Does this make sense to you? That kind of community-splitting effort needs
to stop and that's what I am trying to address.

Cheers,
Paul

Yes, sorry I wasn't clear. I don't want developers who never have to touch 
research-jpa to be forced to build that project everyday. I was thinking 
more along the lines of some sort of POM hack...

Line 238, 246   opertunity -> opportunity

I wonder if a statement of policy should have so much procedure written 
into it.
The procedures will change over time as people change their ideas about 
best practices whereas policies should be less volatile.

It might be easier to state the goals of the policy and leave the 
implementation up to a more informal discussion that takes the actual 
situation into account.

Maven is diametrically opposed to "hacks." If there is a good solution
to your problem, it should not involve a hack. But there may not
(today) be a good solution to your problem (yet).

I'm not certain as I haven't been using skinny wars (or ears) lately.
Hopefully someone else will pipe up.

thank you Curtis: all the pointers you gave are of great value!

I perfectly understand your Githubs examples: pull requests + work to g=

pull requests most chances to be accepted
In fact, in our case, for somebody having commit privileges, using such=

For somebody with commit privileges, would you find any key difference =

For gerrit, now I see what it looks like: seems really more complex tha=

GitHubs pull requests. Don't know when such tooling starts to be really=

The Maven group can always port the code back into the Maven project if 
the other project is OSS.
If it has gone to a proprietary project (lots of open source stuff goes 
that way too), then the Apache maven team will have to invent its own 
future to be better or the same as the alternative future.

Not sure how this could happen in real life.
It sounds like the "future of Maven" resided in the head of one person 
who felt that the Apache Maven project did not have room for its own 
future so he moved on to a team that wanted to make the "future" happen now.

That would appear to be a good thing for Maven users.
The users adopt to this new project and enjoy the future.

The Apache project members who see the "future" as a good thing move to 
the new group and the people who did not want to support the "future" 
keep supporting the old way.

This would not be the first project that died rather than innovate.

You can't write a policy that protects against this and still stays open 
source.
You have no way to stop this from happening nor should you try.

For what purpose?
You can't stop the person anyway and in the discussion, it is fair to 
assume that you would have raised your objections.

The vote will come when a PMC member wants to change the dependency when 
the code comes back.
At that point you have the code and you have a chance to see the new 
functionality or performance to see if the changes live up to the 
advanced billing.

Subject: Trouble with custom titlepages using Maven docbkx plugin to generate output

Hi, all,

I hope someone out there has some tips for me regarding this very confusing
issue I've encountered when I try to generate my HTML output from the
context of the Eclipse Maven docbkx plugin.

In my customization layer I have an import statement to use the custom
titlepage I generated as per the usual method as described in Bob Stayton's
guide.

If I run the Maven build, it fails with this error on parsing that file:

Error at div on line 1838 <my custom titlepage file>:
  No attribute-set exists named topic.titlepage.recto.style

If I comment out the import statement, it builds fine with the default
titlepage settings. But I don't *want* the default titlepage setting -
that's why I generated a customized one.

Looking through the DocBook distribution, I located that attribute set
defined in the file titlepage.xsl in each of the transformation
directories. The definition is simple an attribute set with nothing in it.

So I thought that if I copied that attrtibute-set elemtn into my
customization layer, things should work.

Well, they do - sort of. I get a file with nothing in the top of the page
at all where the pieces the titlepage XSL creates usually appear - the
document title and some other specified metadata.

Outside of Eclipse, if I run the usual command-line transformations,
everything works just like it should.

I suspect there's something I'm not understanding about how the docbkx
plugin accesses the DocBook XSL files, or about how the general
transformation is calling the titlepage XSL file.

Any clues from anyone that might have gone this way before?

Thanks!

Alan

Just my 2 cents : been using gerrit professionally on a daily basis for 8
months now. So there's actually real people using it, I can testify ;).

We're a team of ~10 guys.

(For French savvy people I've given a short talk about it at the Toulouse
jug. The session was recorded ans is hosted on parleys).

You're right. I try to do it as often as I can. But perfection takes a bit
too long to commit/rework and sometimes it's ridiculous ;).

It helps to practice, sure. Btw, Gerrit makes it worse. It almost forces
you to use advances features to make it really useful.
That's why I'd say putting a whole team both beginning with git and gerrit
would be a mistake.

Oops not sure I was clear. I was answering to 'lot of work's part. Not
'anybody...' because I actually do it and know many people doing it very
often. I generally do it almost each time before pushing.

We use the skinny wars / ear and never had this issue. Maybe a dependency
issue with your poms? It may sound stupid, but did you take a look at the
dependency tree to make sure the resolution was OK ?

The cat b / core pmc rule was already adopted to address cases like
this. The pmc voted to allow the previous cases so its not like
anything magical happened here. I don't think we need to be overly
broad to spell out every operating rule in the roles and
responsibilities. Keeping tabs on situations like that is exactly the
role of the pmc and I believe the document covers that sufficiently.

Hi,

Question:
How do I make the DefaultInvoker.executeCommandLine in [2] log the command line

in version 2.0.11 of executeCommandLine there is

if ( getLogger().isDebugEnabled() )
        {
            getLogger().debug( "Executing: " + cli );
        }


I have tried

-X

-Dinvoker.debug=true

-Dmaven.invoker.debug=true


and configuring maven-invoker-plugin with <debug>true</debug> in the


I have also tried to break the invoker, but nothing I do makes any difference


Detail:

Over in Apache Sling my GSoC Student is struggling to build Sling, It
builds for everyone else but him. The log is at [1]. He is running as
root, (bad), in a users home folder, and I have asked him to try
again. He is trying to build tooling/maven/archetypes/servlet from
sling trunk.

eg

svn co https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/sling/trunk
cd  tooling/maven/archetypes/servlet
mvn clean install

Looking at the output and the source code it looks like the maven
shared invoker is failing to launch a new copy of maven from the
command line. I believe the code being used is [2].

Based on looking at the difference between a successful build and a
failing build the invoker never manages to invoke the maven command. I
would like to be able to give him a simple patch, he can apply so we
can see what is going on on his box.

He has been blocked for 2 weeks by this issue.

Best Regards
Ian

Hi,


---
[ERROR] Failed to execute goal  
org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-archetype-plugin:2.2:integration-test  
(default-integration-test) on project sling-servlet-archetype:

[ERROR] Archetype IT 'normal' failed: Cannot run additions goals.
---

according to these lines it is not the maven-invoker-plugin which is used,  
but the maven-archetype-plugin.
For that reason the -D arguments won't have any effect, since they are  
used for a different plugin.

This is the page you are looking for:
http://maven.apache.org/archetype/maven-archetype-plugin/integration-test-mojo.html

Gerrit was created by and for Android: https://android-review.googlesource.=

It's used for Gerrit itself https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com
(dogfooding), Chromium and GWT, on Google infra.
It's also used by many companies contributing to Android (Sony, etc.),
and by Eclipse, Typo3, KDE, LibreOffice, Qt, OpenStack, etc.

Rietveld is hard to install outside AppEngine, that's probably why. I
would have loved to use it at work otherwise, instead of that crappy
ReviewBoard; we've fortunately moved to Git and Gerrit since then.

That said, Gerrit 1.x was started as a fork of Rietveld, but Gerrit
2.x has been rewritten from scratch in Java and GWT, built on top of
JGit.

WAT? You can't wrap your head around a DAG of commits and you want us
other mere mortals to use a tool you're building on top of a DAG of
transitive dependencies? (intentionally provocative tone to motivate
you to reconsider your position about git). Git is easy to work with
when you think in terms of the DAG in your repo; no need to be a git
black belt for that.
I merely use 5 git commands on a daily basis (using "git gui" to do my
commits and deal with my working directory; pull, push, checkout and
"rebase -i"; merges are generally done by Gerrit, at the push of a
button; on a relatively big project like GWT, I tend to use gitk, "git
log --grep", "git grep" and "git blame" quite a lot too; and this only
works well if you have a "clean history", which you cannot have with a
"commit then review" approach =E2=80=93 on master/trunk I mean =E2=80=93 bu=
t of
course, because SVN doesn't give you tools to easily look back at your
commit history, you tend to not care that much about having a "clean
history"; "git svn" mitigates it a bit).

Adding debug does enable debug configuration to the archetype plugin
does generate debug output for the integration tests. Unfortunately
the invoker fails to run the mvn command so we never get that far, and
the debug setting does not cause the integration test mojo to tell the
shared invoker to emit the command its trying (and failing) to run.

Is there a setting somewhere that get the debug statements that are in
the invoker to log at debug level ?

Best Regards
Ian

Brian,

Did you have any suggested changes to the forks section wording to clear up
my intent for that section?

I'd like to start wrapping this up and move towards making it "official"

Everyone else,

Time to shout out if you have any issues / suggested improvements on the
content

Some small formating or typos.
Added commas in a long sentence around line 280 and another one around
l298. I generally find it hard to concentrate on a whole sentence without
commas (or even periods separating ideas).
See https://gist.github.com/Batmat/6155302 for proposed patch.
If you need any other attachment format, just let me know.

Cheers

Hi folks,I am fairly new to maven and I am currently playing with Maven PDF
Plugin trying to generate a document. It works fine but when I need to use
some POM defined properties I hit the wall. For instance if I use .apt.vm
file I enable the filtering, but the properties I have defined are not being
substituted.If I use an apt system property as ${project.name} it works
fine, but if I use ${myProperty} it just don't substitute it.in pom.xml I do
have 			My other value                ....  	and it also works fine if I use
it in pdf.xml, but not if I do it in a content file.Any idea on that issue?
What am I missing?Thanks,Nikola

Hi all,
I am trying to generate a PDF, but I face the following issue.
Although I do have properties defined in my pom.xml they are not properly
filtered in any type of content I use.
 
e.g. I have the property defined in pom.xml 
                <properties>
                               <myProperty>My other value</myProperty>
</properties>
 
If I use this property in pdf.xml it appears in the generated PDF, but if I
set it in an .apt.vm file as ${myProperty} it doesn't. 
The apt file is also with .vm extension as documented on the site. 
On the other hand properties as ${project.name} work fine.
 
Do you have an idea what am I missing?
 
Thanks,
Nikola

Hi all,

As SVN tags are simply a convention overlayed on top of SVN directories, 
SVN tags are therefore mutable.  This opens the possibility that someone 
could inject code to a tag between the release:prepare and the 
release:perform phases.

This would mean that the code checked out during release perform phase 
could be different from the code which was originally tagged.

To close this potential loophole, I'm considering this solution:
1)  Modify the behaviour within 
org.apache.maven.scm.provider.svn.svnjava.command.tag.SvnTagCommand  to 
return the tag revision number via TagScmResult
2)  Write the result to release.properties
3)  Utilise the revision number within the checkout command (tag plus 
revision#)

Does anyone have any alternate suggestion for how to solve this? 

Regards,
Nathan

Hi Nathan,

No one should ever be committing to an SVN tag that already exists. Unless
the team has malicious committers? Or very clueless ones? In which case you
have much bigger problems...

In other words: isn't this more of a social issue?

Hi,

Well, as this is actually something that the SCM itself allows, I would
consider just forbidding on my svn server.

This might be an interesting evolution though to be able to enforce this at
the maven-release-plugin (though unlikely to happen often since the three
usual commits actually happen very close to each others).

Cheers

Hi,

I have a problem with the PMD plugin for maven. For our project I have
defined a custom ruleset for PMD in an XML file [1]. This ruleset defines=

properties for some of the standard PMD rules using this syntax:

<rule ref=3D"rulesets/java/naming.xml/LongVariable">
    <properties>
        <property name=3D"minimum" value=3D"25"/>
    </properties>
</rule>

When I execute PMD using a parallel ant file we maintain, these custom
properties are respected correctly. However, when executing PMD through
maven, the properties are completely ignored.

And idea what could cause this?

Thanks for any help,
Johannes

The pom.xml we are using is available at [2].

Subject: "Unmaving" a project
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable
X-Virus-Checked: Checked by ClamAV on apache.org

Hello,
English is not my native language; please excuse typing errors.
I need to "unmave" a project because in the place I work Maven is not used.
The problem is that I downloaded a lot of source-code from a book and all
it=C2=B4s content are Maven Projects.
I found easy to make the projects work as Maven Projects... just import a
Maven Project, configure my application server - I am using Jboss 7.0, and
run them. I could easily configure this projects after testing it and chang=
e
them to my needs.=20
But since we don=C2=B4t use Maven here, I started trying to disable the Mav=
en
nature of a project and I couldn=C2=B4t get the project to work. I deleted =
the
pom.xml file and added the libs that were necessary to the project classpat=
h
- after clicking in the Eclipse IDE to disable Maven nature.
Is there any other configuration needed? When I want to "unmaven" project,
in addition to the libs, what should I pay attention?
Thanks for your attention.

The original behaviour was to tag the local working copy not the remote
tree, so that you could release at any time without having to for e a
"quiet" period on trunk.

Then a bug in the neon transport for Subversion 1.5 or 1.6 (I cannot recall
which) made tagging from working copies for https based repositories
difficult for users.

Now that serf is the default transport, perhaps we can switch back to the
old behaviour?

Absolutely agree that people should not commit to tags, however we need to 
take a more defensive position to guarantee that there is no route for 
malicious code to "sneak" into the release process.  As release prepare 
and release perform are not atomic, we need a process which guarantees 
what is being built, is exactly the same as tagged code.

Hi Nathan,

No one should ever be committing to an SVN tag that already exists. Unless
the team has malicious committers? Or very clueless ones? In which case 
you
have much bigger problems...

In other words: isn't this more of a social issue?

Hi,

Well, as this is actually something that the SCM itself allows, I would
consider just forbidding on my svn server.

This might be an interesting evolution though to be able to enforce this 
at
the maven-release-plugin (though unlikely to happen often since the three
usual commits actually happen very close to each others).

Cheers

I'm not sure that will help our problem as tags remain mutable.  The tag 
checked out for release perform could still be corrupted.

The original behaviour was to tag the local working copy not the remote
tree, so that you could release at any time without having to for e a
"quiet" period on trunk.

Then a bug in the neon transport for Subversion 1.5 or 1.6 (I cannot

Now that serf is the default transport, perhaps we can switch back to the

You probably need to start by finding out how everyone at your 
organization builds projects.
For example, do they use a set of Ant scripts?

Maven gives you a standard way to do things but if your organization is 
not using Maven, it probably has a "standard" way that all of the 
projects are built.
You may also need to restructure your source tree to match the 
organization's way of organizing a project.

I can not think of any reason why it would be necessary to remove the 
pom.xml or tell Eclipse anything after you have removed the Maven nature.

No one here can tell you how your organization builds its applications 
and that is what you need to find out.

Hi Nathan,

As I asked before: who is doing this "corruption"? If you have committers
capable of doing that, they could absolutely hose your repository in all
sorts of ways. It's a much bigger problem than just the
maven-release-plugin.

That's not to say your proposed changes wouldn't make maven-release-plugin
more robust -- it just seems like an unwinnable battle. Better to go
Baptiste's very sensible route of locking down the server on the
server-side.

-Curtis

P.S. SVN is certainly not unique in having mutable tags. Git's tags are
mutable too: just force push over top the old one. And any VCS having
immutable tags would be a real PITA, IMO.

typically you go

$ mvn release:prepare release:perform -B

So there is maybe a 1 second window when somebody can mutate the tag
between the create and the checkout...

Now if you are doing release:perform a while after the release:prepare (the
tag is created only as the second last operation at end of the prepare step
- the final being checking in the development of next version poms) then it
could be a concern...

But that will always be an issue.... because you could have the case where
the machine with the release.properties has a hard disk failure before you
can run release:perform and as a result you loose the revision detail.

TL;DR for every safeguard you put in place (that is not a rule enforced on
the Subversion server) we can find a scenario that can work around your
safeguard... the solution is a rule enforced by the Subversion server that
only permits creation and deletion of tags and no modification to the tags
themselves (you need delete if you ever want to respin a release... if you
don't want to respin [your name could be sebb or fred :-P ] then don't put
a rule that permits deleting borked tags.

Hi,

I have a problem with the PMD plugin for maven. For our project I have
defined a custom rulest for PMD in an XML file [1]. This ruleset defines
properties for some of the standard PMD rules using this syntax:

<rule ref=3D"rulesets/java/naming.xml/LongVariable">
    <properties>
        <property name=3D"minimum" value=3D"25"/>
    </properties>
</rule>

When I execute PMD using a parallel ant file we maintain, these custom
properties are respected correctly. However, when executing PMD through
maven, the properties are completely ignored.

And idea what could cause this?

Thanks for any help,
Johannes

The pom.xml we are using is available at [2].

Isn't it possible to handle this in a technical manner` For example, a
rigger script that's invoked upon commit and checks whether the path
contains a "tags" directory?

Hi,

I am part of the Apache Flex Team and am currently working on Setting up a =
new Maven plugin for building Apache Flex applications. This will be an off=
icial Apache maven plugin, so would I be allowed to Name it "maven-flex-plu=
gin" or should "flex-maven-plugin" be used instead? I would prefer "maven-f=
lex-plugin" by far, but don't want to have to rename everything in the case=
 this is not allowed.

Chris

All the advice is over at

This has

Important Notice: Plugin Naming Convention and Apache Maven Trademark

You will typically name your plugin <yourplugin>-maven-plugin.

Calling it maven-<yourplugin>-plugin (note "Maven" is at the beginning
of the plugin name) is strongly discouraged since it's a reserved
naming pattern for official Apache Maven plugins. Using this pattern
is an infringement of the Apache Maven Trademark.

Since your plugin isn't hosted inside the Apache Maven source
repository "flex-maven-plugin" looks like the correct choice.

Ok ...=20

well I did read that naming info, I was just confused how to actually read =
it :-)

"Apache Maven" "plugin" or "Apache" "Maven plugin" ... you see there are tw=
o semantics on how you could understand this. In my case it would actually =
be a "Maven plugin" from an Apache Project, but it's not a plugin from the =
"Apache Maven" Project ;-)=20

But I the Definition regarding the Location of the sources is far less ambi=
guous.

I'll stick to "flex-maven-plugin" then.

I had all this "fun" when trying to name the Apache Maven plugin for Apache
Cassandra!

So here goes,

"Apache Maven" and "Maven" are two trademarks that the Apache Maven PMC is
tasked with protecting.

Thus they are only allowed to be used by the Apache Maven PMC.

We sought and got an exemption for permitting the pattern "____ Maven
Plugin" because that pattern makes it clear that the software product is a
plugin for Maven.

Thus the full name of the Apache Maven Plugin for Apache Cassandra is:
"Mojo's Cassandra Maven Plugin"... this name has to dance the fun of making
it clear that the software product is neither originating from Cassandra
nor Maven. If the Cassandra project had agreed to host the plugin, then we
could have simply called it "Cassandra Maven Plugin".

So the short answer is: Unless the plugin is released by the Apache Maven
project, you must name it according to the pattern "____ Maven Plugin"
*and* you must ACK the Apache, Apache Maven and Maven trademarks.

It does not matter whether you are an Apache project or not. The Apache
Maven PMC is tasked with ensuring that the marks delegated to us are
protected. The same responsibility for their marks falls on all the other
Apache PMCs and thus if the Apache Maven project wanted to host a Tomcat or
a Cassandra or a Flex plugin for Maven we would similarly have to assess
what the trademark usages those PMCs permit are and try to identify a way
of complying with those projects exemptions... (thankfully as Maven is our
mark we can put it wherever we like in the name when the project is hosted
by the Apache Maven project)

Hello Ron,
Thanks for your reply.
Where I work there is no use of scripts for creating projects. There is a
base model that is used to create projects, but is not based on Maven, or
Ant, it was created by the company.
There is a "standard way", but this is not I am worried about.=20
Right now, I am just worried with having a project without Maven that "woul=
d
do" the same as the Maven project "would do".
And this is what I am not understanding. I disabled the Maven nature of the
project, added all the jars that where necessary to the project, and it
won=C2=B4t work.
That=C2=B4s why I asked if there were other necessary steps to make besides
disable the Maven nature of the project and add the libs.
Is there other points that I should pay attention when I disable the Maven
nature of a project? What are they?
Thanks for your attention.

You should probably delete all  the eclipse files (.project .classpath,
.settings/* ) and recreate a new java project and eventually edit it to
match the maven project structure (src/main/java ...).

I was able to tackle the issue finally, please find my observations..

-Dmaven.repo.local="path" option is supported in both Maven 2.2.1  and
3.0.x , but in a different way ..

In maven 2.2.1 if you give the value as
-Dmaven.repo.local=../../../repository,
it can't find the mentioned path, so it assumes the repo at the root
location (in Windows its C:\ and in Linux its "/" )

But it was not the case with 3.x, where if you have
-Dmaven.repo.local=../../../repository,
it successfully able to find the repository available in that location.

So in order to get that working with 2.2.1, I had to modify it as follows..
                             -Dmaven.repo.local=${basedir}../../../repository
(or if you give the full path there, it works..but in my case the full path
is dynamic, and depends on the project location)

Thanks
Sajith

What exactly is the "not working" symptom?
Can Eclipse do the validation of the source in the editor or is your 
window full of red X's?

Does it compile? What errors do you get?

Are the project "Java Build Path" libraries, etc. set correctly.

Project ->Clean can sometimes help.

You really now have an Eclipse problem since Maven is no longer involved.
You should probably be checking your project preferences with one of 
your coworkers to see where your setup is different.
If that does not work, start engaging on the Eclipse forum to get rid of 
the errors one at a time.

The validation of the source is all right - no red X=C2=B4s. The Java Build=
 Path
is set correctly.
When running in the application server is where I can see the errors. I
cleaned the project.

"If that does not work, start engaging on the Eclipse forum to get rid of=
=20
the errors one at a time. " - that=C2=B4s what I am doing right now. I came=
 here,
because I thought it was a Maven related problem - since the project was th=
e
same and it was working before. Now I am reading the log and trying to
figure out.

I am using Jboss 7.1 and the error seems to be related to a beams.xml file,
in its loading or compilation... I am doing some research to understand it
better.=20
This project is a JSF application using several CDI beans and an Activiti
process
definition.

I am attaching the log, if anyone has a clue, please give me a hint.

Thanks for your help.

This is not a general, all-purpose Java "fix it" forum. By simply
stating "I am not using Maven" we can tell you immediately that we're
almost certainly the wrong place to ask your questions.

I think you will have better luck (and a better reception) asking
these questions at the Java Ranch or some forums @ Oracle etc as your
problems seem to be specific to JSF and CDI.

Subject: How do I de-activate a profile if another profile is specified?
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
X-Virus-Checked: Checked by ClamAV on apache.org

Hi,

I'm using Maven 3.0.3.  I want to activate a profile (profileA) at all times
unless the user specifically requests profile B on the command line (e.g.
"-P profileB").  However, right now both profiles are active when I run

	mvn clean install -P profileB

and I can't figure out why.  Here's the relevant section from my parent
pom.xml <profiles> section:

                <profile>
                        <id>profileB</id>
                        <properties>
                                <recreateTestDb>true</recreateTestDb>
			...
                        </properties>
                </profile>

                <profile>
                        <id>profileA</id>
                        <activation>
                                <property>
                                        <name>!recreateTestDb</name>
                                </property>
                        </activation>
                        <properties>
                               ...
                        </properties>
                </profile>

Any suggestions how to configure the profiles to get the desired behavior? 
Thanks, - Dave

Start with .1 - really, its quite simple. Always start with 1.1-SNAPSHOT,
2.1-SNAPSHOT, never ever never ever use .0

Then version ranges work perfectly.

Hi Dave,

I didn't look at the Maven source code, but I am guessing all profile
activations are evaluated before any activations actually take place? That
would an intuitive way to code it, anyway.

As a workaround, you could do:

                <profile>
                        <id>recreateTestDbON</id>
                        <activation>
                                <property>
                                        <name>recreateTestDb</name>
                                </property>
                        </activation>
                        ...
                </profile>

                <profile>
                        <id>recreateTestDbOFF</id>
                        <activation>
                                <property>
                                        <name>!recreateTestDb</name>
                                </property>
                        </activation>
                        ...
                </profile>

And have your users enable the feature using:

     mvn -DrecreateTestDb

Regards,
Curtis

Ths is a good example for "activeByDefault" as described at  
http://maven.apache.org/ref/3.1.0/maven-model/maven.html#class_activation

"If set to true, this profile will be active unless another profile in  
this pom is activated using the command line -P option or by one of that  
profile's activators.
Default value is: false."

Besides the usual concrete implementation in maven syntax, you could 
actually do something like:

mkdir profile(x)
mv profile(x-1) profile(x)
mkdir profile(x+1)            # profile(x+1) is in the top-level directory

I am skipping clean phase in CI loop, I want it to execute clean once a day

existing option: 

1. fork clean plugin and modify code to take timespan as conf input and
clean if its building during that time

2. configure maven compiler plugin to mark staleTimemillis to one day, that
will cache classes without modification for a day

Is there any better option ?

Why not simply add another job to your CI server which just runs "mvn
clean" once a day?

Hi,

What are you actually trying to achieve?

IIUC, I think it's more a job for the CI server. For example, if you're
using Jenkins, you could use that one
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Workspace+Cleanup+Plugin (we do
it to remove "target" directories at the end of the build).

Cheers

You could also bring this question to the users list of the CI you're
using. It's rather a question for that list.

@andres yes it is more of CI management tool thing, but I wish we had an
option in maven clean plugin to clean optionally if the compiled stuff are
older than threshold (configurable) milllis


Agree It is more CI thing, I am using bamboo and don't have an option to do
it in clean way (that I know of)

Thanks!

Hi,

The Mojo team is pleased to announce the release of the sonar-maven-plugin
version 2.1.

This plugin allows to inspect code with SonarQube.

http://mojo.codehaus.org/sonar-maven-plugin/

To get this update, simply specify the version in your project's plugin
configuration:

<plugin> <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
<artifactId>sonar-maven-plugin</artifactId> <version>2.1</version>
</plugin>

This new version adds the support of Maven 3.1. Note that upgrading to
SonarQube 3.7 is required to benefit from Maven 3.1. Older versions of
SonarQube are still supported when using Maven 3.0.x.


http://jira.codehaus.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12430&version=18062

Enjoy,

The Mojo team.

-- Simon

https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-clean-plugin/clean-mojo.html#skip is
the key to get you out of your hole.

You write a custom plugin that just sets the property `clean.skip` to true
if the classes are new enough... a simple plugin to write.

Then bind that plugin to the pre-clean phase of your pom (in a profile that
is only activated by the CI system)

and as you are invoking the `clean` phase and not the `clean:clean` mojo
directly, the pre-clean phase will run first, the property will get set,
and bob's a male sibling of one of your parents!

Hi,

we have a parent pom where all of our projects get it's settings from
(plugin version etc.). In that parent pom there is a
distributionManagement section with all the needed sections for
deployment. Now the settings for "site" prove to be a big problem.

Whenever a site is deployed a command is issued like that:

Executing command: cd
"/var/www/html/maven-docs/projectA-1.0/subProjectB"; unzip -q -o
"wagon7218022527119219133.zip"; rm -f "wagon7218022527119219133.zip"
Executing command: chmod -Rf g+w,a+rX /var/www/html/maven-docs

"projectA" is a multi module project that uses the mentioned parent pom
and "subProjectB" is a module with "projectA" as its parent.

The files for the site of subProjectB a dropped to the right directory
(/var/www/html/maven-docs/projectA-1.0/subProjectB) but the following
"chmod" always issues the directory two levels higher. At this level
thousands and thousands of files are laying there so this command takes
a few minutes. Things get worse with more modules of projectA.
The whole release process waits 95 percent of time for that "chmod" to
complete.

It would be better if chmod would only run on the directory that was
created earlier (/var/www/html/maven-docs/projectA-1.0/subProjectB).

How can that be accomplished?

Kind regards

Thomas

So...  They released sonar-maven-plugin 2.1...  and my corporate pom is nic=
e enough to developers to choose the right sonar plugin based on maven vers=
ion...

                <profile>
                        <id>maven-2</id>
                        <activation>
                                <file>
                                        <!-- basedir expression is only rec=
ognized by Maven 3.x (see MNG-2363) -->
                                        <missing>${basedir}</missing>
                                </file>
                        </activation>
...
                <profile>
                        <id>maven-3</id>
                        <activation>
                                <file>
                                        <!-- This employs that the basedir =

>
                                        <exists>${basedir}</exists>
                                </file>
                        </activation>

Now I have a problem...

The profile maven-3 will be activated for 3.1, and I have no currently know=
n way to determine if it is 3.1 or not.


I am looking to get some suggestions from the community as to the best way =
to compensate for this issue.  I don't see any new variables I can test, an=
d I dont see any properties which show the maven version...




Thanks,

Roy Lyons

Hi,

you don't need to add a new profile. the new plugin is still compatible
with maven 3.0.x (See comment [1])

Hi!

One profile may not deactivate another profile. Maven should know the list
of active profiles before building the model. Profile activation is done on
very low level, almost on XML level during building the model. Once the
model is built, you cannot de/activate a profile, because you will have to
rebuild the model completely. There is also another problem: if one profile
could de/activate another profile, that would make it possible to introduce
cyclic dependencies between profiles.

Two options were already noted here:
* Set one profile to activeByDefault; it will be automatically deactivated
when another profile is activated.
* Use property to activate one account and !property to activate another;
you will have to activate your account by specifying -Dproperty in the
command line. I personally dislike this method, but that's the matter of
taste, there's nothing wrong with it.

There is another way, which is my favorite. It may or may not work for you,
depending on what's happening in your profiles. The idea is to remove
default profile completely. Define default behavior in main section, and
override it in profiles as needed. For example:

<project>
   ...
   <properties>
      <property>default value</property>
   </properties>
   ...
   <profiles>
      <profile>
         ...
         <properties>
            <property>specific value</property>
         </properties>
      </profile>
   </profiles>
</project>

You can actually do a lot of things with this approach:
* Redefine dependency versions, scopes, or even group or artifact ids.
Define a property with dependency id, set default value in main section and
override it in profile. Use this property in dependency declaration.
* Redefine plugin versions or parameters. Same as above.
* Activate or deactivate plugin executions. Many plugins have skip
parameter, you may use a property to set it to true in main section, and
set it to false in profile (or vica versa).

I prefer this method, because it produces smaller POMs. For example, I
don't have to declare a dependency in profile again, only to redefine its
version or scope. Same goes for plugins and plugin parameters.

Besides, it is possible to override any property in command line, which is
very helpful at times. For example, I always define properties for plugin
versions, and I can override plugin version in command line for testing
purposes without editing the POM.

Hope it helps.

I try to publicize my project.

 

I have two projects that I compile tonight.

 

The dependency compiles and uploads on mysite.be

 

But the dependent myproject doesn't download the dependency.

Subject: Accessing "Sibling" Module Source Folders

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

I want to read .h .hpp files from a sibling project's source folders,
during the "generate sources" phase

Right now I have a multi-module test (of my Mojo) with
 - parent (the parent project)
 -- hello-world (a child project that's a hello-world test of the plugin)
 -- why-hello-there (a child project that depends on an artifact generated
by hello-world)

Here's my problem;
 - on its own, hello-world compiles happily and generates an artifact
consisting of .h and .hpp files
    >>> This works
 - in a multi-module build, "generate-sources" fails in why-hello-there
    >>> it can't find the dependency for hello-world (hello-world has not
compiled yet)
    >>> ... but tests where hello-world was separate, and not a sibling,
had this working fine
    >>> So I need to pre-scan for "siblings" right?

AFAIK something like this "must" work since "Normal Maven" can do this.
Maven's compiler plugin auto-magically detects the things ... somehow ...
how does Maven's compiler do this?

Can I recursively scan folders / pom instances from the current project to
detect siblings? but if the siblings are generating sources I won't see
them ... will I?

I configured wagon extension to push over ftp.

I have sources under scm mercurial.

And I have declared a distributionManagement

Really, I don't understand.

Do I really need a public Tomcat server? Because I use Apache and ftp.

Subject: How to pass the contents of a file as the value of a command-line
 parameter when invoking a maven goal
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
X-Virus-Checked: Checked by ClamAV on apache.org

Hi,
I need to pass the contents of a file as the value of a command-line
parameter when invoking a maven goal.

Why? 
The maven goal I am calling would trigger a server process on a certain
port. This goal will be setup in a Jenkins build as a continuous integration
test job. And there could be more than one such jenkins job. So I want to
ensure that each server process starts on a different port. 
I have scanned for an available port in a "pre-build" step and have written
the identified port to a file port.txt and have ensured that it is available
in the Jenkins job's workspace before the Maven build is triggered.

What I want to do now is specify a maven goal like below within the Jenkins
job I'm writing:
integration-test clean install -Dport=$(<port.txt)

Assuming that port.txt only contains a string like "6001", the above command
should (at runtime) become:
integration-test clean install -Dport=6001

And when the job runs, a client should connect a url constructed as below:
http://localhost:6001/web_service/myapp

Note that the port in the above URL is taken from incoming command-line
parameter 'port'.

However, when I configured this into Jenkins, the job failed with the
stacktrace containg the below:
Caused by: java.net.URISyntaxException: Illegal character in authority at
index 7: http://localhost:$(<port.txt)/web_service/myapp

I am executing the job on Linux and have verified that $(<..) is supported
on the version of the shell that I am running. So I think replacing
$(<port.txt) with `cat port.txt` is not the answer that might help me. 
The problem seems to be lying in the way I'm using the maven command-line.
Looks like the shell is passing everything it sees on the command-line to
Maven which has no clue how to handle it!

Hope I made the problem clear. All help is appreciated.

Hi,

Can't you use

 ?

Hi,

This is how we solved this problem:
On the Jenkins buildserver we added the following to our settings.xml

<profiles>
   <profile>
     <id>jenkins</id>
     <properties>
       <port>600${EXECUTOR_NUMBER}</port> <!-- port could be for any  
plugin, so not really a good name -->
     </properties>
   </profile>
</profiles>

<activeProfiles>
   <activeProfile>jenkins</activeProfile>
</activeProfiles>

This assumes a maximum of 10 executors on the buildserver.
Now you don't have to specify the port on the commandline, it'll be picked  
up from these settings.

I'm not sure anymore if we had to expose these JENKINS variables and if it  
had to be prefixed with "env.", but this should be enough info to solve  
your problem.

Robert

Thanks for replying Adrien. I didn't know about that mojo, so will surely
check it out.
However,  my problem will be solved the fastest if I can find a way to pass
the port as a -D parameter to achieve the deadline as the remaining things
are in place. I can use the suggested mojo as an enhancement in a
subsequent iteration.
Any immediate solutions?

Hi,
Sure Tomcat isn't required (btw, Apache Httpd also supports webdav).

>From the error excerpt you provided("http//", not ftp and missing ":" ?), I
suppose you didn't configure correctly your distributionManagement.
Deploying to ftp is indeed supported. Did you correctly declare the
wagon-ftp extension, like described here:
http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-deploy-plugin/examples/deploy-ftp.htm=
l

Could you show us your pom (putting it on some place like pastebin or
gist@github), or even better a test project?

Cheers

    Could not find the main class: org.sonatype.mavenbook.App.  Program will
exit.  

The project was created successfully:
   mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=org.sonatype.mavenbook.simple \  
   -DartifactId=simple \  
   -Dpackage=org.sonatype.mavenbook \  
   -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT 

and built:
  $cd simple
  $mvn install

What can be wrong with my java command that causes this exception?
(the .java file is present as is the .jar) so what can be the problem with
the java command?

Check the content of the jar file. Is there a file called (including path)
/org/sonatype/mavenbook/App.class? Java says there isn't.

Anders, the actual path inside the jar is:

Turns out I can't reproduce your issue using Maven 3.1.0 and
maven-archetype-plugin 2.2. Possibly you were using an older version of the
archetype plugin with a bug regarding what package name is used.

I also can't reproduce. I must have crossed the groupId and package, please

Subject: Does each maven goal have it's own classpath?
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

Reading the Sonatype tutorial at
http://books.sonatype.com/mvnex-book/reference/simple-project-sect-simple-c=
ore.html
I see this:

  Maven also provides for different dependency scopes. The simple project=
=E2=80=99s
pom.xml contains a single          =20
  dependency=E2=80=94junit:junit:jar:3.8.1+=E2=80=94with a scope of +test. =
When a dependency
has a scope of test, it will=20
  not   be available to the compile goal of the Compiler plugin. It will be
added to the classpath for only the  =20
  compiler:testCompile and surefire:test goals.

This implies that each plugin goal can have it's own classpath. Is this
correct?

Thanks & regards,
Jarlath

Ok, here is the mindf?ck...

The strict answer to your exact question as worded (not the one you are
trying to ask) is:

yes, each mojo (a.k.a. plugin goal) invoked gets it's own classpath
consisting of the core Maven classpath plus the dependencies of the plugin
that declares the mojo.

But that is not the answer to the question you think you asked...

Each mojo can request the list of dependencies of the project and can
filter those dependencies based on the specified scopes of those
dependencies.

So a mojo can say, give me the list of dependencies and filter out so that
only those that make sense for the scope=3Druntime are retained.

The mojo can then construct a classpath from that list of dependencies.

Now one issue that a mojo may encounter is that the dependencies in the
list may not be resolved yet. This is usually addressed by the mojo being
flagged as requiring dependency resolution. It will usually include a
scope. A mojo may say it requires dependency resolution of scope =3D compil=
e
but at runtime take the list of dependencies that are filtered with scope =
=3D
runtime. This could lead to issues if the mojo is not coded to take
additional defensive measures... by and large, mojo authors do not want to
take that responsibility on themselves, so typically
requiresDependencyResolution is a strong indicator of the scope that the
mojo is interested in.

As there are only 4 main scopes (we will ignore `system` and `import`)
there are thus at most 4 distinct classpaths that a mojo can construct
(without taking additional information from the mojo configuration into
account)... so for mojo's designed to operate on Java projects, there are
effectively at most 4 classpaths that a mojo can pick from... so that would
be a semi-qualified no to the answer you think you were asking.

Hopefully the above will lead you to ask some more questions of yourself
and get you towards enlightenment

Thanks Stephen Connolly, I need to look into scope a bit more to interpret
your answer better, but I get the gist of it and you've unblocked me from
continuing with the tutorial - thank you.

Subject: Making parent pom the absolute authority over it's children's
 versioning
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
X-Virus-Checked: Checked by ClamAV on apache.org

I have a project laid out like this:

+parent-project
 -child-project1
 +child-project2
  -src
  -child-project2.pom
 parent-project.pom
 
The parent defines its own version:
  <version>4.4.5-SNAPSHOT</version>
  
And child-project two has in it's pom:
  <parent>
		  <groupId>com.company.it.apps</groupId>
		  <artifactId>parent-project</artifactId>
		  <version>4.4.5-SNAPSHOT</version>
  </parent>  
  
The issue I'm having is that I want the person doing the builds to only have
to change the <version> in the parent-project. I want the child-projects to
*take* their version from there so that he only has to make one change. But
if I change the child to declare it's own version as:

  <version>${parent.version}</version>

this actually takes it from the version declared in the child .pom. Yet, if
I don't delcare the version in the child pom it won't know which version of
the parent to go for... 

Am I trying to do the impossible? I don't want to have every child's pom
modified to go from SNAPSHOT to release because in reality the projects are
much larger.

Thanks & regards,
Ten

"this actually takes it from the version declared in the child .pom."
By this I mean it takes it from the childs own definition of the parents
version, not the *actual* parent version as declared in the parent.

This is currently impossible.

The best you can currently do is inherit xpath:/project/version from
xpath:/project/parent/version

The primary historical driver for this requirement is that with some SCM
systems (especially subversion) people can checkout only the child module,
so there would be no way to build the child project without the parent
project being checked out also.

A long standing RFE is to permit inference of xpath:/project/parent/version
provided that there is a pom on disk at the path specified by
xpath:/project/parent/relativePath *and* that project's
xpath:/project/(groupId,artifactId) match the child's
xpath:/project/parent/(groupId,artifactId) my understanding of one of the
blockers for this RFE is that the deployed pom to the remote repository
would need to include at least xpath:/project/parent/version so that legacy
and non-maven clients can parse the pom correctly *and* the GPG signing
issue that plagued Maven 2.1.0 and 2.2.0 resulting from trying to resolve
portions of the pom at run-time before deployment to the remote repository,
resulting in invalid GPG signatures, has still not been fully resolved
(hence the rollback of that "feature" in 2.2.1)

The reality is that the maven release plugin (or the versions maven plugin)
will handle updating the versions for you.

Istead of editing the parent pom by hand, you could use a maven to do 
this for you. This will change all versions in the child 
projects/directories as well:

mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=1.0.0.20-SNAPSHOT

Kind regards,
Joachim

Stephen Connolly, thank you. I'm going to look into that plugin and try to
automate this process during build-time.

Joachim Van der Auwera, thanks. I'll use this solution while I learn how to
implement Stephen Connolly's idea.

Best regards,
Ten

Given the future of computation and being in a technological 
singularity, how do we divert a total disaster when the 'machines' have 
solid bodies? Since Hume, we have had theories about "ghosts in the 
machine", and if we look even at the beginnings of AI since MIT, it's 
clear that the software often has a mind of its own and takes us on 
courses we never intended to go on.

Finite-state automata, with no solution to the Halting problem, actually 
have exhibited free will and agency. In that respect, how do we 
reclassify our notions of human and animal rights when such a species 
actually has the entire compendium of human history, knowledge and the 
universe? Think Data from Star Trek.

Sounds like a bug to me. Would you open a Jira issue for that?

Given the recent activity on our vote threads, I fear this has already happened.

Ten,

you might not need version in your child pom.xml files, if child pom.xml
already have parent pom version.
In my multi module project, with following structure - 4 pom files, 1 for
the parent, and 3 for modules:

+ parent (pom)
- child1 (jar)
- child2 (jar)
- child3 (war)

I'd define version in parent pom, but in childX poms, there will be no
version defined, apart from parent's version inside //project/parent/vesion

Regards,
Ziga

Hi Ziga,

That's very nice. When I omit the <version> for the child, the build adopts
whatever is declared for <parent><version>, which reduces the amount of
work I need to do. Thanks for the tip.

Regards,
Ten

I'd like to install some Java command line tools, without having to
configure PATH manually. Can mvn do this? Package managers from other
programming languages often offer this ability, like RubyGems and NPM.

If not, is it conventional to deploy Java command line tools through
apt-get, brew, chocolatey, etc.?

The command "mvn install" installs the project in your local repository; so
that other maven projects don't need to download it from a remote repository

I think that's your decision - check what platform / OS you want to target.

If you're making a tool that works on maven projects you probably want to
make a maven-plugin and mojo

Is the path setting a configuration for a plugin? Is it just a property?

If I correctly understood the Maven way, you should wrap your
phantomjs executable in its own project, so to deploy an artifact to
your repository (or at least to have such an artifact in your reactor
project). Then you can use the Maven Dependency Plugin to copy the
phantomjs artifact in the projects which use it.

I am compiling for ARM and use different compilers, so I am installing =

You're right. You shouldn't access things from another module this way.

You could indeed package your dependency as a standard one, or even create
a dedicated plugin) that could use that dependency or even the dirty
decompression work ;)).

Maven is more a build tool than a package manager (though "maven
repositories" might look so).

If you could clarify what you expect, then maybe we can tell you better if
maven could fit in some way.

I defined a profile for Linux to set a path to a Linux executable.  The exe=
cutable is 64-bit, and the architecture is 64-bit (the "uname -a" output ha=
s "x86_64").  I didn't put anything in the profile specification for archit=
ecture.  For completeness, I wanted to define a profile with 32-bit Linux, =
along with a 32-bit executable, and have them fired correctly.  I first jus=
t tried changing the one profile, adding "<arch>x86_64</arch" to the "os" e=
lement.  Unfortunately, the profile didn't activate, so I'm guessing Maven =
saw a different architecture value.  How do I know what architecture value =
Maven is going to detect?

Hi All,
I searched the list and read the assembly plugin documentation, but I
cannot understand what I am doing wrong. I have a master pom that contains
a number of  modules (See attached). I want to use the assembly plugin to
package a final distribution containing what's generated by the modules. I
understand I should use ModuleSets in the assembly (also attached).
But when I run it, get the following output and the assembly plugin
complains about no files included (that is consistent with the message that
says no modules are processed). What am I doing wrong?

Thanks in advance

Hello,

use mvn -v, you'll see a line about OS information. These are the values
maven reads.

Alan, we have the exact problem that you have. We just upgraded from Maven

Did you manage to resolve your problem? Do you have any hints as to what is
going on?

First, please be aware that you've disclosed the password for your Archiva
admin account on a mailing list. I strongly advice you to change it.

Reading your mail more thoroughly, I now think the problem is that you use
dav for deploying. Any reasons for that? Surely Archiva supports plain
http, doesn't it?
Maven 3.x doesn't support dav out-of-the-box, but you need to add some
config to your pom for that. You would find instructions on the Internet on
how to do it. However, I think you should try to switch to plain http
instead.

Subject: Maven 3.1.0 fails to resolve artifacts produced by reactor build
From: Severin Gehwolf <jerboaa@gmail.com>
To: users@maven.apache.org
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
X-Virus-Checked: Checked by ClamAV on apache.org

Hi,

We are currently using Maven 3.0.5 to build our project called
Thermostat[1]. Our build produces zip files at some stage of the
reactor build and uses those artifacts later as dependencies in order
to produce what we call a Thermostat installation image. That image is
just a bunch of files with a predefined directory layout.

We've discovered that our build works with Maven 3.0.5 but fails to
build using 3.1.0. Details as to how to reproduce this are in this
bug, which has a simple reproducer attached:
http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MNG-5503

Are we doing something wrong? Is this expected behavour?

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks,
Severin

I agree that this is a regression. I have asked Jason to take a look before
he cuts the next release

You might want to break this up into pieces and see what part fails.<br>
This is too big and complicated at the moment for most people in the forum =
to dig through.<br>
Find out which piece is failing.<br>

Hi All,<br>
I searched the list and read the assembly plugin documentation, but I canno=
t understand what I am doing wrong. I have a master pom that contains a num=
ber of modules (See attached). I want to use the assembly plugin to package=
 a final distribution containing what&#39;s generated by the modules. I und=
erstand I should use ModuleSets in the assembly (also attached).<br>

But when I run it, get the following output and the assembly plugin complai=
ns about no files included (that is consistent with the message that says n=
o modules are processed). What am I doing wrong?<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance<br>
<br>

Subject: Difference between Eclipse build errors and Maven build
 dependencies
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
X-Virus-Checked: Checked by ClamAV on apache.org

I've checked out a project that is active in pre-production from SVN and it
builds fine with Maven. However, in Ecilpse there are markers for 'Java
build path problems', 'Java Problems', 'Maven Dependency Problems', ,'Maven
Problems' and 'XML Problems'.

I know there was a transition from managing dependencies with Eclipse to
using Maven so can I ignore the Eclipse dependencies et al? It doesn't make
sense to have two dependency managemnet systems. Also, given the BUILD
SUCCESS, can I safely ignore the other Markers in Eclipse?

Hi TenLeftFingers,

Are you using File > Import > Existing Maven Projects to get your Maven
project into Eclipse? Are you using Eclipse for Java 4.3?

Did you tell Eclipse that this is a Maven project and has its 
dependencies defined by Maven?
Does your Eclipse support Maven?
I use Eclipse/STS from Springforce so Maven support is built-in.

Hi Merve,

just curious, but ... could it be that project is in ISO-8859-1 and you're
building it locally with UTF-8?
I remember getting  strange '=EF=BF=BD' messages which disappeared after ma=
king
sure same encoding was used in source version control as on my machine.

Regards,
Ziga

Hi TenLeftFingers - I've struggled with this a lot in the past few months -
here's what I've learned:

When you have everything set up right, there should neither be eclipse
errors nor maven errors.

When an eclipse project is a maven project, m2e (the eclipse-maven
integration) will automatically add all maven dependencies to the eclipse
build classpath and will automatically attempt to resolve managed
dependencies during workspace build. So one thing to check here is that if
the dependencies are not managed dependencies, then eclipse won't be able to
find them in your local repository.

In eclipse you can right-click on a project and go Maven-->Update Maven
Project and this will tell eclipse to update all of its local project
settings (e.g. source and build paths) based upon the current pom.xml.

Another behavior to note is that with m2e 1.4 or later, the integration is
smart enough to recognize if one eclipse project has a maven dependency on
another eclipse project.  So if "ProjectABC" has a maven dependency on
"ProjectXYZ.1.0.0-SNAPSHOT", and ProjectXYZ is also in your eclipse
workspace and its pom.xml specifies 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT, m2e will recognize this
and use the workspace project for that dependency. This is very convenient
so you don't have to a maven install on ProjectXYZ and update ProjectABC for
every code change - you can just code away on ProjectXYZ. 

Note: with the above setup, there is no need to configure ProjectXYZ from an
Eclipse standpoint to have ProjectABC as an included project on its build
path. M2e handles that for you, and if you have both, you'll end up hiding
potential maven problems from you.

It even works for J2EE applications e.g. if ProjectABC is a web application.
The caveat here is that you must be using maven-war-plugin version 2.4 to
generate your war file this way - I have explicitly set that version in my
plugin configuration.

I hope this helps!

Best regards,

Richard

Richard's description is much better than my cryptic note.
Once you have the project set up properly all the cute little red "X"s 
go away since Eclipse and it editors finds everything it needs from the 
information in your Maven pom.
The integration is very well done and causes no grief or extra work as 
you work.

Hi,

If the build is correct, the platform encoding shouldn't be an issue.

Does it happen with a pristine checked out/cloned repository or did you
touch anything?

It's also worth noting that M2E has a mailing list as well which can be
quite helpful for troubleshooting eclipse-maven specific issues.

Lastly remember that eclipse has maven 3.0.4 bundled into it. You can add
additional older or newer maven runtimes to eclipse if necessary, similar to
the way you add additional JRE runtimes, server runtimes etc.

Best regards,

Richard

Subject: Re: Difference between Eclipse build errors and Maven build
dependencies

Richard's description is much better than my cryptic note.
Once you have the project set up properly all the cute little red "X"s go
away since Eclipse and it editors finds everything it needs from the
information in your Maven pom.
The integration is very well done and causes no grief or extra work as you
work.

Hi,

I have 24 modules within my project. Each module reference the parent pom, =

which defines the actual version of snapshot or deployed project.
As maven requires a constant for the definition of the version, 25 poms=20
must be edited just to increment the version of 0.1 point. This is very=20
boring!

To overcome the issue an environment variable has been defined like:=20
APP=5FMONTEROSA=5FVERSION=3D1.0.01.GA for instance. Changing to the Version=
=20
1.0.02-SNAPSHOT, now requires one change in one place!

The parent pom defines the version as: <version>
${env.APP=5FMONTEROSA=5FVERSION}</version>

And all related modules define the version of the parent the same way.

This works! However, as we all know maven issues a [WARNING] 'version'=20
contains an expression but should be a constant.

Which apparently can safely  be ignored. However I would like to know if=20
an other approach exist. The "version" plug-in gives me the impression of=20
an overkill, for such a simple case, hence I never tried it up to now.

Instead of the environment variable, maybe a definition within a kind of=20
xxx.properties could be more adequate.

Every hint is welcome. Thanks in advance.

Hi all - I've been stuck for a while trying to get an artifact injected by a
plugin to apply to subsequent plugins/goals in a project.

I have a project which generates a web application. My use case here is the
obfuscator plugin which I wrote, which creates a jar file called
"<projectname>-small.jar". The plugin creates jar file using
MavenProjectHelper.attachArtifact(). The plugin executes during the
packaging phase, before the maven-war-plugin. The jar file is created
successfully, and the call to attachArtifact() returns with no errors, but
the maven-war-plugin does not "see" the jar file and therefore doesn't
include it in the results. When I turn on debugging I can see
maven-war-plugin copying the other project artifacts into
target/<projectname>/WEB-INF/lib.

Have I missed a step? I know I can explicitly configure maven-war-plugin to
grab the new artifact, but I thought the point of "attachArtifact" was to
inject the new artifact into the flow. 

Appreciate any insight into what I'm doing wrong...

Thanks!

Hence use the release plugin when releasing or cutting branches... Use the
versions plugin for more custom version number changes

Nope... Take a look at the file deployed to the repository cache... This
*will* blow up in your face.

Stop and think about this for a second.
How many projects are using Maven?
Do you really think that doing this manually would be considered best practice?
Tedious, automatable tasks are an itch that wont be unscratched for long.

You're best bet would be to do some reading of the freely available
books at http://maven.apache.org/articles.html

You could even have a scan of the plugins at
http://maven.apache.org/plugins/ and see if there are any descriptions
that might help.
release : Release the current project - updating the POM and tagging
in the SCM. SVN JIRA
(which as Stephen points out is the one you want)

If you just want to do some bulk editing, then
versions : Manage versions of your project, its modules, dependencies
and plugins.

I concluded that this was a missing feature of maven-war-plugin, where it
simply wasn't looking to see if there were attached resources.

I supplied a simple patch to the handleArtifacts() method to have that
method also handle attached artifacts,  You can see the report here.

The Maven team is pleased to announce the release of the Maven
Surefire Plugin, version 2.16

This release addresses some serious problems with character encodings in
the test report XML files and adds a new Parallel Computer implementation
to the JUnit 4.7+ provider, offering a bunch of new options and features
around in-process parallel execution (submitted by Tibor17, thanks again!).

You should specify the version in your project's plugin configuration:

<plugin>
  <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
  <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>2.16</version>
</plugin>

Subject: Re: How to pass the contents of a file as the value of a
 command-line parameter when invoking a maven goal

Hi,
Thanks for the suggestions. I did try configuring the reserve-network-port
goal in my pom.xml so that it sets the randomly selected port into the
property jetty.proxy.port. Then I used the properties maven plugin to write
this property to the file
${project.build.testOutputDirectory}/integration-autogen-maven.properties.
This seems to work well but fails when the property is being written to the
file. The error is "Caused by:
org.apache.maven.plugin.PluginExecutionException: A type incompatibility
occured while executing
org.codehaus.mojo:properties-maven-plugin:1.0-alpha-2:write-project-properties:
java.lang.Long cannot be cast to java.lang.String".

It looks like the properties plugin is failing to convert the reserved port
63174 into a String to write to a file, but I am not able to figure out why.

The relevant snippet from pom.xml and the error stacktrace from Jenkins is
appended below for your reference. I am inches close to getting this done
and a little help from you would make my day. 

Thank you!

Why oh why do people always go for the most complex way to solve a
problem... using 10 million plugins when one will do
[/aside]

You were on the right track with this... you just picked a phase of `test`
which is too late in the game as the lifecycle executions will happen
before any executions added by the pom... Pick the port at the `validate`
phase so that it is available for resource filtering...

 <plugin>
   <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
   <artifactId>build-helper-maven-plugin</artifactId>
   <version>1.8</version>
   <executions>
      <execution>
          <id>reserve-network-port</id>
          <goals>
             <goal>reserve-network-port</goal>
          </goals>
          <phase>validate</phase>
          <configuration>
             <portNames>
                <portName>jetty.proxy.port</portName>
             </portNames>
          </configuration>
       </execution>
    </executions>
 </plugin>

Now at this point you have two choices as to how to pass the port to your
test code.

Option 1. Use resource filtering
Option 2. Use a system property

This all depends on how your tests work....

Option 1

Put the following (you can rename or move as you see fit) as
src/test/resources/ports.properties

jetty.port=${jetty.proxy.port}

Then add the following to your build section

<testResources>
  <testResource>
    <!-- we are defining test resources, so need to add the defaults with
exclusion for filtered resources -->
    <directory>src/testresources</directory>
    <filtering>false</filtering>
    <excludes>
      <exclude>ports.properties</exclude>
    </excludes>
  </testResource>
  <testResource>
    <directory>src/testresources</directory>
    <filtering>true</filtering>
    <includes>
      <include>ports.properties</include>
    </includes>
  </testResource>
</testResources>

And you are done.

Option 2

Just tell Surefire to pass the system property

<plugin>
  <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
  <configuration>
    <systemPropertyVariables>
      <jetty.port>${jetty.proxy.port}</jetty.port>
    </systemPropertyVariables>
  </configuration>
</plugin>

Oh and one final thing, when you are writing your tests to read in the port
from either the property file or from the system property, if the value
read is missing or is not a number you should assume a default port... this
is so that IDE integrations will still be able to run the tests without
having to delegate to Maven for building (the modern IDEs know how to do
this... but sometimes they make mistakes).... something you will thank us
for later.... especially once you have test failures to debug.

Hello,
Im very new to Maven (im researching it)
Im assigned to project that using maven.
I got the message when use command: Maven Test in eclipse.
Currently I don't know how to fix it :(
Can anybody help me? I really don't know the root cause....
I appreciate too much...
I comment main code to find why the bug happens but I have no idea.
The source code is very simple  (of course there are some heritances...)

Richard,

AFAIK attachArtifact just tells Maven to install an additional binary to
it's local cache resp. to deploy it to the distribution repository.

What you want, as far as I understand, is to create an artifact which will
be picked up later on and included in a war? You should probably create a
separate module project, which creates the jar and just include this jar as
runtime dependency in your war project.

Regards Mirko

Thanks Stephen - that solved it.
I had not researched the surefire/failsafe configurations enough. I've used
option 2 and passed the port to the failsafe plugin as it is an integration
test. Also, the phase I have used is pre-integration-test. There is a
default port already setup in a properties file and now the randomly chosen
port overrides it as a system property. 

Overall, problem solved. Thanks to all for the very prompt replies.

Hi,
does anybody have experiences with https://github.com/tesla/tesla-concurren=
t-localrepo?
Does it work well?

I want to use it in a 'normal' maven build.
Is there an example on how to use it / how to configure it?

You probably should have a look to the surefire reports to see the output
of the tests and why it failed.

Reports are usually in target/surefire-reports but you seem to have its
location overriden in your pom.

Thank you Mirko, I got a similar reply on Jira. I'll do as you =
suggested.

Richard,

AFAIK attachArtifact just tells Maven to install an additional binary to =
it's local cache resp. to deploy it to the distribution repository.

What you want, as far as I understand, is to create an artifact which =
will be picked up later on and included in a war? You should probably =
create a separate module project, which creates the jar and just include =
this jar as runtime dependency in your war project.

Regards Mirko

AFAIK, with xml entities not supported and mixins still unimplemented, 
your best bet is to use the release plugin to update the versions 
without going at it manually.

Richard,

AFAIK attachArtifact just tells Maven to install an additional binary to =
it's local cache resp. to deploy it to the distribution repository.

What you want, as far as I understand, is to create an artifact which =
will be picked up later on and included in a war? You should probably =
create a separate module project, which creates the jar and just include =
this jar as runtime dependency in your war project.

Hello Richard,

x-posted to dev, as the war-plugin is a core-plugin:
- IMO attaching would be the "wrong" term as it has another meaning.
- This is more of a "generated" jar (as generated sources,  classes etc.)
- IMO packages should go in Maven modules of their own.

Regards Mirko

In my project,there is a TestBase class. All tests in the future will extend
from this class.
I have just created a basic test extends from that class. Then maven clean
install => Build success.
Next I  select maven test. It failed.

I try to debug backing up code from Test Base and add basic code to run and
It failed when I add some codes relating to testing. It passed with syso
only.

I will work on this project and maintain it. The problem is I dont know
where the issue from: my test or maven or report??? Actually code in test
very basic...

I hope receive more ideas about it.... :(

   }
   
}
================================
This is my basic class test:

package com.validant.enigma3.samples;

import java.io.File;

import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;
import org.openqa.selenium.chrome.ChromeDriver;
import org.testng.annotations.Test;

import com.validant.enigma3.common.TestBase;
import com.validant.enigma3.common.UIMap;

public class HoangTest extends TestBase{

	@Test
	public void myTest1()
	{
		System.out.println("START MY NEW TEST_01");
	}
	
	@Test
	public void myTest2()
	{
		System.out.println("START MY NEW TEST_02");
	}
}

=========================
And pom file is the same previous post

There is no report in this case. Just only report  pass cases and failed
cases that return assert false... (as i know from the author of this project
but she left... :(  )

Thank you
Hoang

Subject: Any way to generically specify a release version in a child POM
 when using the Maven release plugin?
MIME-Version: 1.0

Hi,

I'm using Maven 3.0.3.  I have a multi-module project and want to use the
Maven release plugin (through Jenkins).  When running release:prepare, the
process dies with the error

=09Executing Maven:  -B -f /scratch/jenkins/workspace/subco/parent/pom.xml
-amd -pl org.mainco.subco:childModuleA -DdevelopmentVersion=3D38.0.1-SNAPSH=
OT
-DreleaseVersion=3D38.0.0 -Dusername=3Dmyuser -Dpassword=3D********* -P pro=
d -P
cloudbees -DskipTests -Dresume=3Dfalse -DdryRun=3Dtrue release:prepare
=09=E2=80=A6
=09message : Failed to execute goal
org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-release-plugin:2.0:prepare (default-cli) on
project childModuleA: Can't release project due to non released dependencie=
s
:
=09    org.mainco.subco:childModuleB:jar:38.0.0-SNAPSHOT:compile
=09    org.mainco.subco:parent:pom:38.0.0-SNAPSHOT


Is there another way I can write the child dependency so that a release
version will be used?  I could hard code things but then I would have to go
and update all my child poms every time I want to use the Maven release
plugin, which seems to defeat the purpose.

The problematic child module (similar to others) is setup like so =E2=80=A6

        <artifactId>childModuleA</artifactId>
        <packaging>jar</packaging>
=09=09...
        <parent>
                <artifactId>parent</artifactId>
                <groupId>org.mainco.subco</groupId>
                <version>38.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
        </parent>
=09=09...
        <dependencies>
=09=09=09...
                <dependency>
                        <groupId>org.mainco.subco</groupId>
                        <artifactId>childModuleB</artifactId>
                        <version>${project.version}</version>
                </dependency>



Thanks, - Dave

Hey Ziga,
Is it possible to do the same thing for test-jar's?
It looks like maven still wants the version.
Is it OK just just use ${project.version} in that case?

Ignore my last email. <inserts foot in mouth>
It would help if I had the version entry on the parent pom.
Example:
<dependency>

<groupId>org.mainco.subco</groupId>
<artifactId>childModuleB</artifactId>
<version>${project.version}</version>
<type>test-jar</type>
<scope>test</scope>

</dependency>

Would need to check but maybe try adding -DautoVersionSubmodules=3Dtrue so
that all modules get released with that version.

My 2 cents.

@Bret, as you've figured out already, it works for non-jars. In case of a
war, you just add artifacts type (<type>war</type>). :-)

@Baptiste, yes, for the release itself. I find it even more practical to
have configuration for maven-release-plugin
<autoVersionSubmodules>true</autoVersionSubmodules> in project's pom.

Ziga Gregoric

Hi Nikola,

Sorry it took me so long, but you wrote just when my vacation started...

I think this is a feature that was never implemented, as the docs [1] 
only mention "... System properties, Maven project properties and some 
date properties." that can be filtered, ie no custom properties.

However, given that this works fine with the site plugin I would call it 
a bug really, consider filing an issue in jira: 
http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MPDF

cheers,
-Lukas

I have a resource file named "Mise =E0 jour.pptx" under test/resources/pptx=
.

The file was created on Windows, checked into CVS and checked out onto a Li=
nux server.

The filename on Linux now contains \o340 (which is the ISO-8859-1 / Win-125=
2 encoded value for the =E0).

When running mvn -e clean on the project, I get (under maven-clean 2.5):

I've changed the filename to replace the "=E0" with a plain "a" and it work=

If so, are there other workarounds (i.e. besides renaming files)?

I have a resource file named "Mise =E0 jour.pptx" under test/resources/pptx=
.

The file was created on Windows, checked into CVS and checked out on a Linu=
x server.

The filename on Linux contains \o340 (which is the ISO-8859-1 / Win-1252 en=
coded value for the =E0).

When running mvn -e clean on the project, I get (under maven-clean 2.5):

I think that I speak for everyone when I say, we saw this email
yesterday. We are (nearly) all volunteers. I know this is a BIG HUGE
PROBLEM that needs to be fixed yesterday in your world, but please be
patient. If you are resending in case the first one got lost, please
check the Maven User archives at Nabble.com or Markmail.org.

I would agree this is a likely explanation for the error you are seeing.

I am unaware of workarounds. Unless you have some time to devote to
the clean plugin to update it to use NIO.2 classes in a compatible
way.

Or perhaps modify your SCM to run a pre-commit-hook and change file
names at check-in?

Hi,

Have a look at http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MCLEAN-48

We've added an integration test for it, since we (or I) couldn't reprodu=
ce  =

it.
The integration test will verify that it can delete both files and  =

directories with special characters.

These tests are run on several different systems without any problem.

What happens if you check out
http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/maven/plugins/trunk/maven-clean-plugin/

and execute

mvn verify -Prun-its

Robert

Hey all - just wanted to let the list know that I completed the 1.0 release
of my obfuscation maven plugin and its available on the central repo. The
full artifact is "com.idfconnect.devtools:idfc-proguard-maven-plugin:1.0.0".

I got some very helpful answers from the list - mainly I was stuck on the
exact definition and purpose of "attaching" a generated artifact back into
the project. It took me a while to understand that this is not intended as a
mechanism to inject an artifact into subsequent plugin processing, but is
solely for adding artifacts back to the repositories.

The plugin uses the 3.1-specific API - it was very easy to ask maven to see
what dependencies have already been resolved in the project, and also to
programmatically resolve any new dependencies specifically needed for
obfuscation. The source could be useful for anyone else developing a new
plugin for 3.1, although I'm certainly no authority on the API!

I took pains to make the plugin configuration as "maven-esque" as possible.
The plugin website is here: http://mavenproguard.sourceforge.net/ and all of
source code is on SourceForge. There's a brief explanation of how to use and
an example based of how I used the plugin to obfuscate a specific set of
libraries within a web archive here:
https://sourceforge.net/p/mavenproguard/wiki/Home/

Any feedback appreciated. Thanks!

Best regards,

Richard

Maybe I'm just not thinking the Maven way . . .

My ultimate goal is to create a web form driven application that allows 
some slight customization of another web application delivered as a WAR 
file. The bulk of that application consists of a WAR overlay, and the 
user ends up creating two files to add to that overlay.

I can do this by hand, and all works as expected.

In order to start out with this, I thought I would write a small program 
to create an artifact and then build it.

I'm using maven invoker and that seems to do what I need, except I'm 
unable to do two things.

1. read profiles
InvocationRequest request = new DefaultInvocationRequest();
List<String> profiles = request.getProfiles(); // profiles is null

I have some profiles in ~.m2/settings.xml, and one is set active since 
it controls all my proxy settings.

2. Specify directories

I would like to specify the directory where archetype:generate is run, 
and I would like to specify where the target gets placed. I would 
happily settle for the first, since I know that the resulting WAR file 
will be in target.

I'm running this against Maven 3.1 with JDK 1.7.0_25 on Windows at the 
moment. The target system will be running Linux, but it's Maven so that 
shouldn't matter.

I've tried (rather naively) to set the basedir property by loading a 
Properties object into the request, but that seemed to have no effect.

I was hoping to set the build directory in a profile, but I don't seem 
to be reading profiles.

Input (including don't do this admonitions) happily taken.

. . . . just my two cents.

Hi,

be aware that a Request/Result are pojo's: just a number of getters and  
setters.
This is done to have control over the number of arguments. Now we can call  
on a Invoker instance:

   InvocationResult execute( InvocationRequest request )

If we need more 'arguments', we'll add it to the request, while the method  
signature stays the same.

1. Here's the Javadoc for InvokerRequest.getProfiles():

/**
  * Gets the profiles for the Maven invocation.
  *
  * @return The profiles for the Maven invocation or <code>null</code> if  
not set.
  */
List<String> getProfiles();

So this will contain the arguments which you pass as -P profile1

2. Use Invoker.setWorkingDirectory( File workingDirectory );

Check http://maven.apache.org/shared/maven-invoker/usage.html for more  
details.

And thanks - a more careful reading (not without coffee) works. I'm off 
and running. This looks like just the way to go.

Hi all,

Mirko thanks for your reply. I think the plugin API should have *some* =
simple mechanism for transferring a "generated" artifact from one plugin =
to the next.

In my example, the project creates a standard named artifact i.e. =
"${project.build.finalName}.war", and the obfuscation plugin also a new =
(generated) jar artifact with classifier "small", i.e. =
${project.build.finalName}-small.jar, specifically with the classes it =
has processed.

To get the war file to include this new generated artifact, I have to =
place it directly into the WEB-INF/lib folder, whereas by default it =
would go into ${project.build.directory}. Obviously this isn't =
burdensome. But my question was whether it would make sense to have the =
war plugin consider attached artifacts. I actually created issue =
MWAR-304 with a simple patch to do this, but the developer agreed with =
your point that attaching an artifact should only be used for placing =
said artifact into a repository, not as a mechanism for propagating the =
artifact to other plugins (https://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MWAR-304).

However this general use case (propagating a generated artifact between =
plugins) continues to vex me. Example - I tried using the mojo shade =
plugin to generate a jar to include in a web application.  Same type of =
use case - I want the shade plugin to use the artifact generated by a =
previous plugin. The shade plugin only accepts an artifact as an input, =
I cannot give it a path to a filename to include as I did above with the =
war plugin. So either way I need to modify the shade plugin - either to =
accept filesystem paths to include or a Boolean to tell it to check for =
dynamically attached plugins. Since Maven 3.0 includes =
MavenProject.getAttachedArtifacts(), it seems silly not to use it. If a =
plugin is going to accept artifacts as input, why shouldn't an attached =
artifact be considered? It seems like the natural and transparent =
mechanism to propagate generated, attached artifacts between plugins. =
Just choose your classifier and go.=20

Granted, the shade plugin should also have a parameter to include =
filesystem paths.

Best regards,

Richard

Hello Richard,

x-posted to dev, as the war-plugin is a core-plugin:
- IMO attaching would be the "wrong" term as it has another meaning.
- This is more of a "generated" jar (as generated sources,  classes =
etc.)
- IMO packages should go in Maven modules of their own.

Regards Mirko

Sorry just correcting myself, I was referring to the maven shade plugin =
not mojo shade plugin.

Subject: RE: artifact attached by plugin not appearing in subsequent =

Hi all,

Mirko thanks for your reply. I think the plugin API should have *some* =
simple mechanism for transferring a "generated" artifact from one plugin =
to the next.

In my example, the project creates a standard named artifact i.e. =
"${project.build.finalName}.war", and the obfuscation plugin also a new =
(generated) jar artifact with classifier "small", i.e. =
${project.build.finalName}-small.jar, specifically with the classes it =
has processed.

To get the war file to include this new generated artifact, I have to =
place it directly into the WEB-INF/lib folder, whereas by default it =
would go into ${project.build.directory}. Obviously this isn't =
burdensome. But my question was whether it would make sense to have the =
war plugin consider attached artifacts. I actually created issue =
MWAR-304 with a simple patch to do this, but the developer agreed with =
your point that attaching an artifact should only be used for placing =
said artifact into a repository, not as a mechanism for propagating the =
artifact to other plugins (https://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MWAR-304).

However this general use case (propagating a generated artifact between =
plugins) continues to vex me. Example - I tried using the mojo shade =
plugin to generate a jar to include in a web application.  Same type of =
use case - I want the shade plugin to use the artifact generated by a =
previous plugin. The shade plugin only accepts an artifact as an input, =
I cannot give it a path to a filename to include as I did above with the =
war plugin. So either way I need to modify the shade plugin - either to =
accept filesystem paths to include or a Boolean to tell it to check for =
dynamically attached plugins. Since Maven 3.0 includes =
MavenProject.getAttachedArtifacts(), it seems silly not to use it. If a =
plugin is going to accept artifacts as input, why shouldn't an attached =
artifact be considered? It seems like the natural and transparent =
mechanism to propagate generated, attached artifacts between plugins. =
Just choose your classifier and go.=20

Granted, the shade plugin should also have a parameter to include =
filesystem paths.

Best regards,

Richard

Hello Richard,

x-posted to dev, as the war-plugin is a core-plugin:
- IMO attaching would be the "wrong" term as it has another meaning.
- This is more of a "generated" jar (as generated sources,  classes =
etc.)
- IMO packages should go in Maven modules of their own.

Regards Mirko

One way people on this list implement this is by viewing their various
Maven modules as being a series of transformations which are applied
to successive artifacts.

lib, common, etc
depended on by war
depended on by obfuscator
depended on by shader
depended on by assembly
eventually produces an obfuscated, shaded war file in a tar.gz along
with the latest compatible version of Tomcat in an OS-specific package
ready for simple deployment.

An Ant-oriented person might put all this in a single Maven module and
force the various plugins to bind to different phases and customize or
hard-code the configuration to force this pipeline just to achieve all
of this in a single module build. A Maven-oriented person probably
would not.

Hi Wayne - that seems a very inefficient approach, having 5 or 6 =
separate modules to manage to achieve a single assembly. The point is =
that maven does have phases, goals, lifecycles - why not use them? The =
MavenProject object already provides the mechanism for one plugin to see =
the attachments from a previous plugin, so again it=E2=80=99s a why-not =
question.

The way you present the choice of having a single maven module certainly =
makes it sound distasteful, but I think dividing the construction of a =
single atomic component into multiple modules because the plugins cannot =
be chained together is more unappealing. Especially when the maven =
architecture and API makes it so easy to do.

BTW I haven't touched Ant in at least 6 years, so I doubt I'm an =
"Ant-oriented person".  :-)

The MavenProjectHelper.attachArtifact requires a type or classifier in
order to be used.

The default artifact and the attached artifact are different
dependencies, and so you need to specify them twice for them to be
included in the webapp.
One for the default artifact and one for the attached artifact (which
has the type or classifier specified so that you can tell the
difference).

I dont use the war plugin, but I specifying the dependency on the
attached artifact should mean that it appears in your war.

Have you tried this?

And better still, since the obfuscated artifact *should* have the same
transitive dependencies, it would be the one case where two artifacts from
the same module would be ok.

OTOH if obfuscation adds shade-like dependency reduction *then* it needs to
get a separate GAV

I've tried it to the extent possible, yes. I attach with a classifier
"small" to indicate the obfuscated (and shrunken) jar. The maven war plugin
will look at the MavenProject.getArtifacts() to pull in the scoped
dependencies, but it doesn't look at MavenProject.getAttachedArtifacts().
There just isn't any hook there to get the plugin to process the attached
artifact - best I can do is write it directly into WEB-INF/lib and let the
packager pick it up.

So my proposal was to add a Boolean to the war plugin to tell it to include
any attached jar artifacts. I could optionally add a classifier name, e.g.
add only an attached artifact matching the artifactid of the project and
with this classifier. Or a list of any arbitrary artifact ID strings which
match attached artifacts... for my specific use case simply the Boolean will
do. 

And similarly I want to make the same change in the maven shade plugin. The
shade plugin is very focused on the primary artifact of the project, so for
that I was thinking to just adding the Boolean and classifier - as Stephen
points out, the attached artifact with classifier should have the same
transitive dependencies anyway.

The larger question is how to move generated artifacts from one plugin to
another. The pushback I've gotten on these proposed changes to the plugins
is that attachment isn't supposed to be used for that purpose - attachment
is solely for putting artifacts into the repository, and not for passing
newly generated artifacts between plugins.

New feature perhaps? Idea being the notion of transient artifacts which only
persist for the life of a maven session? Then other plugins in the same
execution which potentially could use these transient artifacts could either
automatically look for them or be configured to do so, like I suggested
above for the war and shade plugins. The only difference between the
transient and attached artifacts is that the transient wouldn't get
persisted to a repository. And if you want to attach it, a plugin like the
mojo buildhelper could have a goal to attach any (or specific) transient
artifacts.

If I'm talking crazy, please forgive me, school started today for my 2nd
grader and I haven't had my coffee yet. :-)

Thanks!

-Richard

Subject: Byldan, NPanday or MS-Build & Maven Which would be the preferred

Hi,

We have a C# project which is build using "Byldan" .
Now we are kind of thinking of replacing the "Byldan" with some other Build
tool. Preferably the two options we have is:-
1) NPanday
2) MS Build along with Maven

I would greatly appreciate if you could throw some light on this, and which
would be the preferred tool going ahead.

Thank you in advance.

Regards
Achyuth

Not saying this is ideal for all scenarios. Just saying it is one
solution that works out of the box and it leaves the door open for
customization you may need along the way. People here oftentimes say
they "just want to do X" and so we provide some advice. Then they come
back a week later and say well actually they need variants of X for
different clients, environments, architectures, etc so they share how
they've been going down the path of profiles which most of us here
believe is the wrong way to do things. I'm just trying to ensure you
know TMTOWTDI (perl-ism). :)

I don't disagree. As I said, this is based on my assumption (perhaps
wrong) that you have left a great many details out of your original
query, and the next few emails will describe a monstrous beast you
have created with profiles and binding plugins to various lifecycles
etc in an effort to do "all the work" in a single project/module. ;-)

> BTW I haven't touched Ant in at least 6 years, so I doubt I'm an "Ant-oriented person".  :-)

Didn't mean you were necessarily Ant-oriented. I know you've released
some Maven plugins lately. Thanks for your work in the Maven
ecosystem! :)

I have an .ear file that I build using Maven.  I rely on the
maven-javadoc-plugin's jar goal to build javadoc for me.

I use the includeTransitiveDependencies property to allow my .ear project
to be fully javadoced: all the stuff that it depends on has -sources.jars
and my intent is to have the plugin process them.

Left to my own devices, I'd declare most of my dependencies in this project
as <scope>runtime</scope>.  I notice that when I do this, the javadoc
plugin runs and effectively does nothing.

Is it intentional that the includeTransitiveDependencies property only
"works on" compile-scope dependencies?

Thank you,
Best,
Laird

Hi,

Did you try to find the project page of the versions-maven-plugin[1]?
On the mainpage of this plugin (as for almost every plugin at Codehaus  
Mojo and Apache Maven) there's a paragraph 'Usage', which refers to the  
FAQ of the plugin, a mail archive and a reference to the users mailing  
list.

Robert

Hi all,

Is there an easy way to split build server run into a compilation and a
test step that runs as two build jobs?

I split build execution on my build server into two steps:
- compilation    mvn clean deploy -DskipTests
- test               mvn surefire:test failsafe:integration-tests
failsafe:verify

This keeps tests that run amok from blocking generation of artifacts for
people to use in testing.  Ideally, I'd have no tests that could stall a
build.

However, I'm running into problems with this solution as some modules
require additional plugins to execute goals prior to failsafe test
execution.  I can determine all of those plugins and goals, then add them
to my job definition but this seems fragile.

Ideally, i'd like a set of job steps like so:
- compilation of core
- parallel compilation of unrelated modules on multiple machines
- parallel unit and integration tests on multiple machines
- collection of results

However, this does run against the maven way.

Have any of you run into this kind of situation and did you find a
satisfactory way to execute individual lifecycle phases without executing
all previous phases?

In the worst case, I can re run the compilation during test, but since
compilation involves GWT which takes about 15m to compile or recompile I'd
rather not double compile anything.

Thanks for the help

Peter

Hi,

Did you try to find the project page of the versions-maven-plugin[1]?
On the mainpage of this plugin (as for almost every plugin at Codehaus Mojo=
 and Apache Maven) there's a paragraph 'Usage', which refers to the FAQ of t=
he plugin, a mail archive and a reference to the users mailing list.

Why not just move the tests into a different module, then you can run

mvn clean install -fae

If they are runtime scoped dependencies then you don't reference them from
the "source" so there is no need to merge their javadoc in...

That could be a justification for such a treatment... not that I am saying
it is the way things should be, just a potential explanation.

We have a main build that produces both jar and test-jar files and
runs just the unit tests (annotated in TestNG). We then have a
separate integration test project which is essentially just a pom.
That project pulls in and runs the previously compiled tests in the
test-jar files against the previously complied jar files:

      <!-- scan jar files for tests -->
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
        <configuration>
          <includes>
            <include>**/*Test.java</include>
            <include>**/IntegrationTestListener.java</include>
          </includes>
          <argLine>-Xmx${tests.testng.maxheap} -XX:MaxPermSize=196M</argLine>
          <systemPropertyVariables>
            <logback.configurationFile>${tests.testng.logback}</logback.configurationFile>
          </systemPropertyVariables>
          <parallel>${tests.testng.parallel}</parallel>
          <threadCount>${tests.testng.threads}</threadCount>
          <groups>${tests.testng.includedgroups}</groups>
          <excludedGroups>${tests.testng.excludedgroups}</excludedGroups>
          <dependenciesToScan>
            <dependency>com.opengamma.platform:og-timeseries</dependency>
            <dependency>com.opengamma.platform:og-util</dependency>
            ... and so on
          </dependenciesToScan>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>

    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.opengamma.platform</groupId>
      <artifactId>examples-simulated</artifactId>
      <version>${project.version}</version>
    </dependency>

    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.opengamma.platform</groupId>
      <artifactId>og-timeseries</artifactId>
      <type>test-jar</type>
      <version>${project.version}</version>
      <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>

While not exactly the same as your case, I suspect it can be adapted.
Main thing is that it avoids the second compile while still keeping
the tests with their correct project.

Both are interesting solutions.  In either case, I'd could configure
desktop developer build to support unit and integration test execution the
standard maven way and then use a build profile to skip test execution on
all standard modules and add in additional modules specifically for test
execution.

I'll have to look into that.

Thanks

Peter

Hi all,

Wayne, thanks for the feedback. I understand where you're coming from. =
I've written out here a concrete example of what I want to do with these =
plugins, and with maven in general wrt passing generated artifacts =
between plugins. Hopefully others will weigh in on whether this approach =
is good and maven-esque.

I have 4 maven projects:

1) a global parent pom
2) a common API project which creates a jar
3) a web application project (a Jersey JAX-RS service fwiw) which =
creates a war and depends on #2
4) a java client for #3 (based on JerseyClient), which also depends on =
#2

1st example: In project 3, I use my obfuscation plugin on the common API =
and the generated classes. That resulting jar file needs to go into the =
WEB-INF/lib folder of the war file. My proposed change to the maven war =
plugin would make it automatically look for a generated jar artifact =
attached to the project from a previous plug-in and package it =
appropriately. The current alternative, which admittedly is no big deal, =
is to simply have the output artifact created by my plugin go directly =
into WEB-INF/lib. But adding a boolean config variable to =
maven-war-plugin to tell it to look for attached jars and include them =
seems logical as well as trivial to me, but this could just be because =
of my relative newness to all things Maven

2nd example: in project 4, I again use my obfuscation plugin on the =
common API and generated classes, and then want to take that artifact =
and, along with the rest of the dependencies, use the maven-shade-plugin =
to build an "uberjar". More problematic than example 1 above because the =
shade plugin only looks at artifacts and has no hook to include anything =
directly from the filesystem. So what I did was modify the shade 2.1 =
source to include a new configuration parameter. For simplicy's sake I =
simply called it " alternativeInputClassifier". When present, it =
instructs shade to look for an attached artifact with the artifact name =
of the project, of type jar, and with the specified classifier, in lieu =
of processing only the main project as input. It was a very minor change =
and I'm happy to provide the diff for it. The result is that my pom.xml =
for project 4 looks like below and works beautifully. One pom with two =
profiles:

	<dependencies>
		....
		<dependency>
			<groupId>com.idfconnect.myproject</groupId>
			<artifactId>common-tools</artifactId>

	</profiles>

So I'm getting a decent amount of mileage out of the notion of using =
attachArtifact as a method of passing generated artifacts from one =
plugin to the next.=20

So... now that I've modified maven-war-plugin and maven-shade-plugin to =
look at attached artifacts, would anyone like me to submit the patches =
on JIRA? I actually modified the shade plugin so you can run shade as a =
standalone goal, e.g. explicitly specify the input artifact in the =
plugin configuration and mvn shade away....

Also I'd like to suggest in any event that, for a future version of =
maven, it add a "transient artifact" space to maven sessions to allow =
this communication between plugins without actually writing the artifact =
to the local repository.

Looking forward to hearing your feedback. Thanks!

-Richard

I don't disagree. As I said, this is based on my assumption (perhaps
wrong) that you have left a great many details out of your original =
query, and the next few emails will describe a monstrous beast you have =
created with profiles and binding plugins to various lifecycles etc in =

Didn't mean you were necessarily Ant-oriented. I know you've released =
some Maven plugins lately. Thanks for your work in the Maven ecosystem! =

Hi,

I have checked the change log for the maven-changes-plugin, looking for
any fixes to missing links to the issue trackers:

http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-changes-plugin/changes-report.html

Unfortunately I found that the log has not been updated since 2005. It
is a pity that the very developers don't find it so useful as I do ;-)

Best regards,

Rafa

The report to look at is the one based on the JIRA tickets:

The changes report should be removed. Thanks for reporting; I've filed a

Hello Apache Maven community,

To reproduce random failing test issue, I'm trying to run two tests in
parallel, but start running them in specific order. Problem is that
runOrder (added via SUREFIRE-614) doesn't seem to be respected, at least
not when forkCount and/or test is specified as well.

When trying to run two tests from Apache Mahout core module (trunk), I
cannot get surefire to run them in reverse alphabetical order.

Regardless if I run:
mvn -Dtest=*KMeansTest -DrunOrder=reversealphabetical test

or
mvn -Dtest=*KMeansTest -DrunOrder=alphabetical test

the two tests which match the pattern always get run in alphabetical order:

-------------------------------------------------------
 T E S T S

in org.apache.mahout.clustering.streaming.cluster.StreamingKMeansTest

Results :

Tests run: 11, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0




Surefire 2.15 is used, and configuration is:


      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
        <configuration>
          <forkCount>1.5C</forkCount>
          <reuseForks>false</reuseForks>
          <threadCount>1</threadCount>
          <perCoreThreadCount>false</perCoreThreadCount>
          <parallel>classes</parallel>
          <argLine>-Xmx512m</argLine>
          <testFailureIgnore>false</testFailureIgnore>
          <redirectTestOutputToFile>true</redirectTestOutputToFile>
          <systemPropertyVariables>

<mahout.test.directory>${project.build.directory}</mahout.test.directory>
          </systemPropertyVariables>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>


When I use latest surefire 2.16, outcome is even more odd - output that any
of the tests is running takes longer to render, it seems to be rendered
together with info that test has completed, so by looking at build log
output it may appear as if tests were not running in parallel even though
they did:

-------------------------------------------------------

Here is my "mvn --version" output:

[sslavic@laptop core]$ mvn --version

Am I doing something wrong or is this behavior bug (or two bugs) in
surefire?

Kind regards,
Stevo Slavic.

Subject: Overriding a plugin dependency's profile property?

Hi,

I am trying to use the mojo cobertura plugin in our project, and it won't
run on my Mac as the tools jar is in the wrong place.

The plugin depends on cobertura, which defines the following property in
the mac profile:

    <profile>

      <id>OSXProfile</id>

      <activation>

        <os>

          <family>mac</family>

        </os>

      </activation>

      <properties>

        <toolsjar>${java.home}/../lib/tools.jar</toolsjar>

      </properties>

    </profile>

and the accompanying dependency:

    <dependency>

      <groupId>com.sun</groupId>

      <artifactId>tools</artifactId>

      <version>0</version>

      <scope>system</scope>

      <systemPath>${toolsjar}</systemPath>

    </dependency>

This is wrong for Mac OS 10.8.3 running Java 6 on two counts - the lib
directory is at ${java.home}/lib and the tools.jar doesn't exist in the lib
directory as apple decided to put those clases in
${java.home}/../Classes/classes.jar.

All that to ask, how do I get cobertura to look in classes.jar for that
dependency?

I have tried adding my own profile and setting <toolsjar> appropriately,
but it seems to be ignored.  I also tried specifying it on the command
line, and again, it complains it can't find ../lib/tools.jar.

Is this possible?

cheers,

David

its a f*cker but I think it boils down to 'user error'!

`my-mvn-a` and `my-mvn-b` build source jars using:

<plugin>
<groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
<artifactId>maven-source-plugin</artifactId>
<version>2.2.1</version>
<executions>
<execution>
<id>attach-sources</id>
<phase>verify</phase>
<goals>
<goal>jar-no-fork</goal>
</goals>
</execution>
</executions>
</plugin>

In `my-mvn-assembly` I would like to build a zip including jars and source
jars from `my-mvn-a` and `my-mvn-b`.

I am using the following descriptor:


    <assembly
    xmlns="
http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-assembly-plugin/assembly/1.1.2"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="
http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-assembly-plugin/assembly/1.1.2
http://maven.apache.org/xsd/assembly-1.1.2.xsd">
    <id>my-assembly</id>
    <formats>
    <format>zip</format>
    </formats>
    <includeBaseDirectory>false</includeBaseDirectory>
    <dependencySets>
    <dependencySet>
    <outputDirectory>/</outputDirectory>
    <useProjectArtifact>true</useProjectArtifact>
    <includes>
    <include>my.group:my-mvn-a</include>
                    <include>my.group:my-mvn-a:jar:sources</include>
    <!-- <include>*:sources</include> -->
    </includes>
    </dependencySet>
    </dependencySets>
    </assembly>

but only the jar with the compiled classes is included in the zip. Why does
it not include the sources jar build using the maven-sources-plugin?

Did you perhaps try using "ln" to ensure the jar appears where
Cobertura is expecting it to be?

hi Wayne,

Yes, I can create a symlink pointing ../lib/tools.jar to
../Classes/classes.jar which works.

However, it requires all of our devs to add such a symlink and is very
inconvenient.

Seems to me that maven should allow us to override it in the pom, but I'm
struggling to figure out if it does, and if so, how.

cheers

David

Greetings!

I had a question regarding adding 2 well known "directories" to the runtime=
 classpath of the Exec Maven Plugin for the exec:exec action.

I had found some tips that ultimately don't work in this case wherein a "di=
rectory" being added to the class path is a requirement.

The various things I've tried, which don't work are:
1) tried package up the contents of these 2 directories as resources.  this=
 didn't work and it really is not a real feasible long term solution for my=
 problem anyway.  this involved trying to use the "build-helper-maven-plugi=
n"
2) tried to add to the "maven-surefire-plugin" some <additionalClasspathEle=
ments> entries.  this had no effect.
3) tried adding 2 <executableDependency> elements underneath the exec-maven=
-plugin's <configuration> area.  This won't work because these executableDe=
pendencies are assumed to be normal Maven dependencies, of which the type '=
directory' is not supported [as far as I can tell].

I'm looking for advice on what my next steps should be in order to get this=
 working.  Are there any other known techniques, or do we need to patch the=
 exec plugin code? (I'm certainly willing to give that a shot if that's req=
uired).

Sincerely,
Karl Gierach

Help please....

I am using the Maven Assembly Plugin to build a distribution zip and am get=
ting some strange behavior with filename cases (which is a problem because =
we deploy to Unix and Windows - issue on Unix).

POM:
       <plugin>
              <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
              <artifactId>maven-assembly-plugin</artifactId>
              <configuration>
                     <descriptor>./src/main/assembly/dist.xml</descriptor>
<finalName>NG_v${project.version}_${build.date}_rev${build.number}_en_US</f=
inalName>
                     <appendAssemblyId>false</appendAssemblyId>
              </configuration>
              <executions>
                     <execution>
                            <id>make-assembly</id>
                            <phase>package</phase>
                            <goals>
                                  <goal>single</goal>
                            </goals>
                     </execution>
              </executions>
</plugin>


dist.xml:
        <fileSet>
            <directory>${schemas-dir}/templates/en_US</directory>
            <outputDirectory>templates </outputDirectory>
        </fileSet>

In the source directory, the files are ALL UPPERCASE ex: CFG_APPLICATION.XM=
L

However, in the resulting zip file, the plugin puts them in "proper name ca=
se" ex: Cfg_application.xml

I've searched everywhere to see if there is a content check or flag that do=
es this, but nothing...

Has anyone had this issue or can anyone think of options I can try to stop =
this behavior?

Kind regards,

I can't seem to find a detailed description of how updatePolicy affects 
release repository behavior.  Can someone explain or point me to a 
document that does?

I'm also interested in understanding how, if at all, updatePolicy 
affects release-version range resolution with regard to how often 
maven-metadata.xml is checked.  Based on experimentation, updatePolicy 
does not make a difference in how often Maven checks maven-metadata.  It 
always downloads metadata for each range expression referenced 
dependency.  Is there a way to limit range resolution to local 
repository contents when running in offline mode?  I appear to get 
missing dependencies often if I do this.

What version of the plugin (and Maven, and your JDK) is this? And
which OS? Can you create a sample project (zip) and post somewhere
online so it can be downloaded and executed locally to duplicate the
results you're seeing?

I might suggest using the Assembly plugin instead of exec-m-p. It has
a notion of FileSets and knows about directories in addition to
dependencies etc.

I'll have to check the code, but I'm pretty sure that the order of the test
classes to be handed over to the forked VMs is supposed to be what was is
specified with runOrder.

However, using -Dtest=3D might disable the ordering - but again, I'd have t=
o
check the code.

Bit there's more: when having two classes to test and two forked VMs, there
is no real way to tell which test comes first. Both VMs are started right
away and only when the are up and running and ready to execute a test, they
ask the main process for one test class. Which VM will be the first to get
a class is quite random.

For the delayed reporting to console, try removing parallel=3Dclasses from
the config. IThe classes-setting has no effect when forking to more than
one fork anyway. If the output is still delayed then, create a bug-report,
please.

Thanks Andreas,

Removing parallel=3Dclasses did the trick for timely console reporting.
Having parallel=3Dclasses didn't bother m-surefire-p in 2.15 and earlier.
With forkCount > 1 and reuseForks =3D false, parallel=3Dclasses should just=
 be
ignored. But, as long as there is solution, I'm fine.

IMO specifying test parameter shouldn't disable the ordering (runOrder),
since specifying test parameter (by docs) is equivalent to specifying
includes patterns in pom, and includes should be used only to filter
scanned test classes, ordering should be applied after scanning, and before
executing test classes.

I understand that there are no guarantees on order when only two test
classes are run in parallel with forkCount > 1.
Still if runOrder is applied before forking VMs and forked VMs as you
describe poll for next test class to execute, and I run a dozen of tests
(specified with test parameter) each of which takes different number of
more than few seconds to finish, and I have forkCount set to 2, I'd expect
runOrder to be somewhat respected - for the first two tests which get run
it would be random, but for the rest it should be pretty much in specified
runOrder, until two finish at roughly same time and there is (again as on
beginning) concurrency which test class will run next. Do you agree?
I tried that (test specifying dozen of test classes, forkCount at 2,
reuseForks at false, and different runOrder settings), and still I don't
see runOrder being respected.

Btw my original suspicion, that the two of Apache Mahout tests do not run
well together, was wrong - failing test had a bug, it makes use of random
number generator, but didn't set test seed to make execution deterministic.

Kind regards,
Stevo Slavic.

Hi,

I'd like to announce the release of the Textile module for Doxia in version
1.1.0.

The plugin allows users to write content in the Textile markup language.

https://github.com/sebhoss/doxia-module-textile

To use this module, just reference is as a plugin-dependency for the
maven-site-plugin:

<plugin>
  <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
  <artifactId>maven-site-plugin</artifactId>
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.github.sebhoss</groupId>
      <artifactId>doxia-module-textile</artifactId>
      <version>1.1.0</version>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
</plugin>

I had a similar problem and fixed it by setting the stack size -Xss10M. The
output was even more than the max screen buffer, I couldn't even see the
exception message. I found this post by searching "at
org.codehaus.plexus.archiver.AbstractArchiver". Thanks for the solution, it
saved my time.

Hi all,

I would like to know if this behavior is normal while using the maven-shade=
-plugin.

Take this sample pom as input:

                </dependencies>
</project>

And do a mvn clean install.
The real pom that is deployed in the repository is the one that has been "t=
ransformed" by the shade plugin (ie: dependency-reduced-pom.xml)
If I look at this pom, the compile dependencies are removed as expected. Go=
od.
But, if you look at the dependencies with scope test, they is a super stran=
ge behavior:

<project>
  <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
  <groupId>sample</groupId>
  <artifactId>shade-effect</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <artifactId>maven-shade-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>2.1</version>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <phase>package</phase>
            <goals>
              <goal>shade</goal>
            </goals>
            <configuration>
              <createDependencyReducedPom>true</createDependencyReducedPom>
            </configuration>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.mockito</groupId>
      <artifactId>mockito-core</artifactId>
      <version>1.9.5</version>
      <scope>test</scope>
      <exclusions>
        <exclusion>
          <artifactId>hamcrest-core</artifactId>
          <groupId>org.hamcrest</groupId>
        </exclusion>
        <exclusion>
          <artifactId>objenesis</artifactId>
          <groupId>org.objenesis</groupId>
        </exclusion>
      </exclusions>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
</project>

Why are all the transitive dependencies of the test artifacts being exclude=
d ????
It surprise me a lot (and made some of my jobs fails in specific situations=
, for example when using Sonar, but that's another story/problem)

BTW: I use Maven 3.0.5

Thanks for your help.
