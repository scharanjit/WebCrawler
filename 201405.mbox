Thanks for your time

I have started with making red5 "provided" but the build failed since
necessary classes were not found.
May be is there any way to provide dependency before build ...

If not I will try to create optional dependency and another one subproject,
not sure if it will work.

I believe the blog article would be better if you can extend it a little
bit and improve the formatting. Actually I can't se how it can help me :(

Thanks for the help :)

Hi,

The Mojo team is pleased to announce the release of the rpm-maven-plugin
version 2.1-alpha-4.

The RPM Maven Plugin allows artifacts from one or more projects to be
packaged in an RPM for distribution. In addition to project artifacts, the
RPM can contain other resources to be installed with the artifacts and
scripts to be run while the package is being installed and removed. This
plugin does not support the full range of features available to RPMs. In
particular, source RPMs can not be generated and the spec files which are
used do not do any build process (the plugin collects the files and
"installs" them for packaging).

http://mojo.codehaus.org/rpm-maven-plugin/

To get this update, simply specify the version in your project's plugin
configuration:

<plugin>
        <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
        <artifactId>rpm-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>2.1-alpha-4</version>
</plugin>

Release Notes:
http://jira.codehaus.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=11970&version=19640

Enjoy,

The Mojo team.

Rickard von Essen

You might want to blow away the file from your local maven repo and
re-download it.  Possible that you were firewalled away from your repo at
some point?

Hi,

I am trying to understand mavens downloading of snapshots (maven 3.0.4,
vanilla install)

I use only spring RELEASE (3.1.4.RELEASE) builds in my pom and I have no
repository definitions in the pom.
When I display the dependency tree with mvn dependency:tree I also see that
my project has no dependencies on snapshots.

Nevertheless, every day, maven pulls in loads of snapshots from the spring
snapshot repository.

How can I avoid downloading the snapshots?

Do you have repository definitions in your settings.xml file ?

Most likely somewhere in that spring dependency tree is a version range...
you could use dependency management to pin that to a non-range version

Never used "optional".
What classes were missing when you used "provided"?
http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html 
mentions that the transitive dependencies are not available if you use 
provided.
You will have to add any dependencies that your code calls that are not 
part of Red5 but are also used by Red5.

This is a good idea anyway since it documents what libraries your code 
actually uses.
You may want to use a more recent version than the one that Red5 does.

Hi All,

I'm trying to improve our build by using parallel threads (i.e. mvn -T #)

Unfortunately I'm running into an error when I try to use more than 9
threads on this 24 core server:

Has anyone run into this before?  I searched the JIRA for the dependency
plugin and didn't find anything related to this.

Thanks,

If there are specific suggestions or questions about the maven blog 
articles (from anyone), I would be grateful to have them.
They were written rather quickly to explain a technique that we found 
useful. People may have to read more than one of the maven articles to 
get the gist of what we do.

Some of the more experienced and knowledgeable people in this forum have 
some reservations about our approach so I would hesitate to propose it 
as a "Best practice" but it does address the problem that you are facing 
in a way that works in a team environment (small team)
and achieves the objects that we sought
- faster maven build (install,deploy),
- small wars (only our code),
- easy deployment (fewer shared libraries)
- shorter and simpler pom dependency specifications and
- complete management control over versions of third party libraries.

Hi,

When I tried using Maven with IBM's Jazz, I had to manually flatten my 
projects because Jazz could not deal with nested projects (modules).

Was the flatten-maven-plugin designed to solve this problem, or some 
other problems?

Flatten-m-p only touches your pom, not the project. So I think it does not
address your use case.

I have a pretty deep hierarchy of poms, ~ 4 or 5 levels where each level 
contains certain parameters. Sometimes when I want to change one of the 
root parameters and then release I am forced to release 4 or 5 poms, one 
at a time, before I can release the artifact we actually ship, otherwise 
the m-release-p will complain about snapshots. Can this plugin help with 
that? i.e help in releasing a chain of poms in one shot where some of the 
parents have SNAPSHOT dependencies. I cannot release from the higher 
levels because they aggregate the lower levels so this would release a lot 
of artifacts when I am trying to release only one of the leaf ones. To be 
clear, when I release only the higher level poms, I have to disable 
aggregation to avoid releasing too much

In other words, I would need this plugin to basically only flatten when 
doing a release, but i am not sure if the switcheroo happens only at 
deploy time or early on so the snapshot-to-release changes in the pom done 
by the release-plugin would happen in the flattened version

Anyone knows?

Hi,

The Mojo team is pleased to announce the release of the 
flatten-maven-plugin version 1.0.0-beta-1.

Flatten Maven Plugin generates a flattened version of your pom.xml and 
makes maven to install
and deploy this one instead of the original pom.xml.

http://mojo.codehaus.org/flatten-maven-plugin/

To get this update, simply specify the version in your project's plugin 
configuration:

<plugin>
         <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
         <artifactId>flatten-maven-plugin</artifactId>
         <version>1.0.0-beta-1</version>
</plugin>

All you need to do is add the plugin to the plugins in your build section.

This is the initial release.

Enjoy,

The Mojo team.

It turns out dependency plugin is using an old version of doxia (version
1.0, latest released is 1.4) that has known thread safety issues. You
*might* be able to work around this by adding the following dependencies to
the dependency-plugin in your pom:

    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.apache.maven.doxia</groupId>
      <artifactId>doxia-sink-api</artifactId>
      <version>1.4</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.apache.maven.doxia</groupId>
      <artifactId>doxia-site-renderer</artifactId>
      <version>1.4</version>
    </dependency>

See
http://blog.sonatype.com/2008/04/how-to-override-a-plugins-dependency-in-mavenif
you're unfamiliar about how to do this. this might work, but might
also
bug out due to some incompatibility between 1.0 and 1.4 of doxia, I did not
try.



Please file an issue under http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MDEP

Many thanks Kristian!

I am currently dealing with another emergency but as soon as that is over I

I'll add the bug in JIRA as soon as I am able.

Thanks again!

Anthony

I have one archetype A which can be used to generate project B with module =
C and module D. I also need capability to generate second, third etc. modul=
e C that could be added to existing project B.
How could I reuse module C definition in both cases? I could possibly creat=
e one  archetype for module C and one for module D as partial, if this woul=
d work? But would there be a way to reuse these archetypes by another arche=
type that can generate module C and D?

Thanks,
Andre Piwoni

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

The Apache Maven team is pleased to announce the release of the Apache
Maven Shade Plugin, version 2.3.

This plugin provides the capability to package the artifact in an
uber-jar, including its dependencies and to shade - i.e. rename - the
packages of some of the dependencies.

http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-shade-plugin/

You should specify the version in your project's plugin configuration:

<plugin>
  <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
  <artifactId>maven-shade-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>2.3</version>
</plugin>

Release Notes - Maven Shade Plugin - Version 2.3

** Bug
    * [MSHADE-166] - maven-shade-plugin not compatible with Java 8

** Improvement
    * [MSHADE-167] - [PATCH] When individual classes are renamed, they
are not debuggable


Have Fun!

Hi,

The Mojo team is pleased to announce the release of the
buildnumber-maven-plugin version 1.3.

This mojo is designed to get a unique build number for each time you build
your project. So while your version may remain constant at 1.0-SNAPSHOT for
many iterations until release, you will have a build number that can
uniquely identify each build during that time.

http://mojo.codehaus.org/buildnumber-maven-plugin/

To get this update, simply specify the version in your project's plugin
configuration:
<plugin>
<groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
<artifactId> buildnumber-maven-plugin< /artifactId>
<version>1.3</version>
</plugin>

Release Notes
https://jira.codehaus.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12124&version=18855

Enjoy,

The Mojo team.

Hi Bruce,

What does this mean?

What did you tried? Can you show the pom file you used? Can you show the 
output you've got?

Kind regards

Just a small guess: if you're using a versioning control system (svn,git it
mercurial supported), the build number won't indeed change if you're
building the same source code many times: it will reflect the current state
of your tree (say revision for svn, or sha-1 for Git).

Hello,

when I create a minimal POM* and expand it with maven 3.2.1 then I see
an entry in the resulting effective pom:

      <plugin>
        <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>2.12.4</version>
        <executions>
          <execution>

            </goals>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>

(and no plugin management enty). When I run the version:display-plugin-updates
on the same pom, it will print:

[DEBUG] [org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-surefire-plugin].version=null
[DEBUG] [org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-surefire-plugin].artifactVersion=2.4.2
[DEBUG] [org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-surefire-plugin].effectiveVersion=2.17
[DEBUG] [org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-surefire-plugin].specified=false
[DEBUG] [org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-surefire-plugin].superPom.version=2.12.4
[WARNING] The following plugins do not have their version specified:
...
[WARNING]   maven-surefire-plugin ...................... (from super-pom) 2.17

I have no idea why it tells me that the super-pom defines 2.17, is this the expected behavior? In the debug output the versions look better.

Greetings
Bernd

Hi All,

I'm trying to exclude the .gitignore file from the source package generated
with Maven source plugin while executing mvn release:perform, but it did
not work.

<plugin>
                    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                    <artifactId>maven-source-plugin</artifactId>

                        <execution>
                            <id>attach-sources</id>
                            <phase>verify</phase>
                            <goals>
                                <goal>jar-no-fork</goal>
                            </goals>
                            <configuration>
                                <excludes>

<exclude>${project.build.directory}/**/*</exclude>
                                    <exclude>**/.gitignore</exclude>
                                    <exclude>**/.git/**/*</exclude>
                                </excludes>
                            </configuration>
                        </execution>
                    </executions>
                </plugin>

The pom.xml file could be found here:
https://github.com/apache/incubator-stratos/blob/4.0.0-incubating/pom.xml

Really appreciate any thoughts on this.

Thanks

Imesh,

I wonder why you need this, in my usecases the .git directory and
.gitignore are at the same level as pom.xml, the source plugin will
only pick up stuff from src/main/java (and maybe
target/generated-sources/SOURCE_GENERATOR).

Regards Mirko

Hi!

I see strange behavior when using the maven EAR plugin with the
skinnyWar [1] feature, which might be a bug.

Here is the (simplified) module-structure I have:

core
  +-- core-shared

web
  +-- backend
  +-- war

  +-- ear

Usually all modules share the same version (let's say 1.0) number. My
"ear" module includes a skinny version of the war module, "core-shared"
and some other 3rd-party dependencies. This works fine.

However, when I update all modules to version 2.0-SNAPSHOT but keep the
dependency on the "war" in the "ear" to version 1.0, the skinny war is
no longer skinny. Instead the "war" 1.0 in the "ear" contains
"core-shared" 1.0 dependency but the "ear" contains core-shared
2.0-SNAPSHOT. Thus, the dependency is included twice with different
versions.

IMHO the EAR plugin doesn't respect artifact's version information
when removing JARs from the skinny war, but only removes JARs that
match exactly (including version string). I'd consider this a bug. Or
at least a missing feature in the EAR plugin.

What do others think? Should I create a JIRA entry?

thx,
- martin

for java 8 plugin bugs.

what repo do these commits come available in?

for legal purpose ( btw, please dont drill me here), I would like to use
one mirror as a gate way for all of of my project dependencies,and another
mirror as a gate way for all of my plugins and their dependencies


is it possible? Posting a settings.xml config here is very much appreciated


Thanks

-D

BTW

as documented, I am currently  able to get both type of artifacts to use
the same mirror to my repo manager

http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-mirror-settings.html does not
seem to support what I am looking for

Having not done this, here is some more insane advice.

I'd use three.
One proxy to proxy the other two proxies.
All developers point to the master proxy.
You can then configure the master proxy to refer to the project
dependencies proxy and another for plugins dependencies proxy.

You might need a more sophisticated maven repository manager that you can
restrict what is allowed in the proxies (i.e. it just doesn't go and grab
stuff for you).

You're going to have to do a lot of fiddling to get this to work.
I'm not convinced it is going to give you what legal thinks it will...

If you could write up what you tried and whether it worked it would be
helpful for anyone else attempting the same thing...

Hi all,

We released a new version of DynamoDB Maven plugin, which automated
DynamoDB Local start/stop for integration tests. This is a short intro post
about it:
http://www.yegor256.com/2014/05/01/dynamodb-local-maven-plugin.html

Would be glad to hear your comments.

Hi Dan,

Did you consider using nexus? There you can setup any kind of strange 
repo setup your mind can come up with ;-) For your case, create one repo 
for your project stuff and one repo for your plugin stuff. Create a 
group for both for easy access and control access by authorization...

Christian

I'm none to sure that this would even help at all:

Presumably you are trying to separate artifacts used by plugins during 
your build (where you might use e.g. GPL licensed modules) from 
artifacts used as dependencies in your project proper (where using that 
same GPL licensed modules would make your legal department scream) by 
separating the repositories used to provide them.

As far as I know/understand all artifacts are downloaded to the same 
local cache repository (~/.m2/repository), regardless of whether they 
were required by some plugin or as a dependency of your project.

This makes them available for both purposes and thus obliterates all 
your efforts of keeping them separate.

Maven Masters: Please correct me if I'm wrong.

Cheers,
Wolf

I don't think this is correct with Maven 3. Maven 3 uses Aether which AFAIK
keeps the repository id for the artifact to verify from where it was
downloaded. Haven't verified for this use case though.

So, using Maven 3 it should be possible to specify one repository
declaration for your deps and one pluginRepository declaration (with a
different repo id) for your plugins (incl deps). If you msut use mirror
declarations, I would use this for the deps and add exclusions (using '!')
for any pluginRepository.

I don't remember what happens for duplicates.
I think it used to complain that the artifact doesn't exist (if the one it
downloaded from is not available, even though its available elsewhere).

The GPL example isn't a good one, as the output of running GPL is not GPL
itself.

I think Nexus allows you to restrict things by licence so that you can
curate what is available in your repository manager. You'd have to look at
the docs to find out.

Hello,

I'm using maven-bundle-plugin in a project. it generates a jar but its 
packaging type is "bundle".

Maven doesn't complains when I declare a bundle dependency without the 
type property (that defaults to "jar").

In the plugin that I'm developing I need to create some files based on 
that packaging type.
I tried to resolve each direct dependency and tried to get its packaging 
type (the one fixed in its pom), but it is not working, because I always 
get the "jar" value.

    I need to know the declared artifact packaging type. How could I
    achieve this?

    thanks for any tip.

Subject: running integration tests with maven

I currently have some testng integration tests in a maven project. This is
causing problems because the tests get picked up and run during the test
phase, rather than the integration-test phase.

How do I cause tests to be run in the integration test phase rather than
test? All of my tests in this particular module should be run during
integration-test.

I don't really see anything in my pom.xml that specifies phase. This is the
only test specific thing I'm seeing:

<dependency>
<groupId>org.testng</groupId>
<artifactId>testng</artifactId>
<version>${testng.version}</version>
<scope>compile</scope>
</dependency>

That by itself seems to be running the  tests in my class BlahTest.java.
I'm guessing it automatically picks up anything matching Test.java?

Thanks,
Brendan

Hi all,

Does the Apache Maven Project/Community has an official stance about
whether M2Eclipse or maven-eclipse-plugin is preferred way of importing
Maven projects into Eclipse?

I thought M2Eclipse was the blessed way, but I cannot find anything
"official" online.
Only that the maven-eclipse-plugin hasn't been updated for a while, but
that could also be a sign that it has no issue and Eclipse offers backwards
compatibility.

Note: this is not a poll about what you as a developer prefers, I'm looking
for whether there's an official position and which one it is.
Background: I'm in a argument in a code review for an archetype about
whether to include maven-eclipse-plugin configuration within the POM or
not; and any "official" choice would help us avoid "bikeshedding".

I have two projects - A and B. B depends on A.

A is built with a number (call it a build number). B needs to which number
is in A at the time B builds.

Any ideas how to achieve this without any human intervention?

FWIW the use case here is that A is software distributed by B (a WAR
archive). A queries B for an updated build number, thus implementing
"automatic updates". I'm trying to automate the setting of this number
across the two projects but I've drawn a blank inside Jenkins for the
moment.

Subject: How to override settings for maven module
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
X-Virus-Checked: Checked by ClamAV on apache.org

I have a master POM file which defines common stuff such as common 
dependencies like junit and compiler settings.

The compiler settings are set to treat warning as error using 
maven-compiler-plugin and Werror as compiler argument. I have a new 
module which declares the master pom as parent pom, but has generated 
code which has lot of warnings. I would like to disable treating 
warnings as errors only for this module or if possible only for 
generated package or generated source directory.

I tried adding compiler plugin entry in module's pom file. But it looks 
like it overrides from parent. How do I disable warnings for this module 
only?

Regards,

Niranjan

You can see that for the push after the commit, it pushes to ssh://git@gith=
ub.com/{org}/Section4362.git ({org} scrubbed by me), whereas for the push a=
fter the tag, it goes to ssh://git@github.com/{org} - URL should include /S=
ection4362.git at the end. All my pom files specify the correct: scm:git:ss=
h://git@github.com/{org}/Section4362.git

How would URL be changing for tag push and where would it get it from? Buil=
d is obviously failing at that step saying unable to connect to repo.

Subject: How to avoid checking parent project in maven-site-plugin
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
X-Virus-Checked: Checked by ClamAV on apache.org

I have small maven project. I'm trying to add generating site by 
maven-site-plugin, but it doesn't work. When I'm building this project i 
get following error:

[ERROR] Failed to execute goal 
org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-site-plugin:3.3:site (default-site) on 
project [MY-PROJECT]: SiteToolException: The site descriptor cannot be 
resolved from the repository: ArtifactResolutionException: Unable to 
locate site descriptor: Could not transfer artifact 
[PARENT-PROJECT]:xml:site_en:1.0 from/to eclipse 
(http://maven.eclipse.org/nexus/content/repositories/testing/): 
Connection tohttp://maven.eclipse.org <http://maven.eclipse.org/>refused

My project is extension for other project, so in my pom.xml is set 
parent project which isn't mine and I can't add site configuration there.

So is there any chance to skip checking parent project's site in site 
generation?

My pom.xml looks like this:

|    <project>
        <parent>
         <artifactId>|||[PARENT-PROJECT]|</artifactId>
         <groupId>||[PARENT-PROJECT-GROUP]</groupId>
         <version>1.0</version>
     </parent>
         <build>
              <plugins>
                 <plugin>
                    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                    <artifactId>maven-site-plugin</artifactId>
                    <version>3.3</version>
                    <configuration>
                       <reportPlugins>
                       </reportPlugins>
                    </configuration>
                 </plugin>
              </plugins>
        </build>
     </project>
|

And of course i have site.xml file in src/site directory in my project.

Subject: Wagon extensions not available from AbstractMavenLifecycleParticipant
 or maven-dependency-tree?
From: William Ferguson <william.ferguson@xandar.com.au>

I have a MavenLifecycleParticipant in my plugin. It uses
maven-dependency-tree to resolve some deps that we need to do extra
processing on. It works fine if the deps are in the local repo.

But if the s3 Wagon is defined in the project along with a dependency from
the s3 bucket, then the following debug log shows that
DependencyGraphBuilder of maven-dependency-tree can't resolve the s3 wagon,
and the dependency is not resolved now or later in the build, so
compilation fails.

NB If I remove the MavenLifecycleParticipant then the dep is resolved via
the S3 Wagon.

Q1) When are the Wagons configured? Shouldn't it be prior to
MavenLifecycleParticipant being called?
Q2) How can I get the DependencyGraphBuilder to resolve the s3 artifact
from within the MavenLifecycleParticipant?


Here is the stacktrace:

I am looking for a plugin that can generate HTML from markdown document.
This is not about using the site goal but static pages for a site. Anyone
been using something like this?

Cheers,
Paul

To get it working make a copy of the parent with the stuff that you need.

This will at least tell you if you are on the right track and perhaps 
give you the settings that you need to override in the module pom.

Hi,

the first thing in such situations is to create a separate module which 
contains the generation code part. In this module you can change the 
configuration for maven-compiler-plugin via a pluginManagemen block...

So looks like this:

   parent (pom.xml)
     +-- mod-generated (pom.xml)
     +-- mod-the-rest (pom.xml)

If you follow this suggestions you have clear separation of concern for 
your modules and you only need to change the configuration for the 
mod-generated.

Kind regards
Karl-Heinz Marbaise

Hi all mates,

I am developing a new set of reports for Apache Felix and I would like
to include nice icons in order to improve the l'n'f of produced data,
one thing I didn't catch is how to copy images included in my plugin
artifact to the target site.

Any suggestion will be paid back in beers :)

TIA, all the best!

Found the answer, you need to use combine.self="override" in the 
compiler plugin settings. More details at

Hi Kristian,
I was also getting the following error

I am using maven 3.1.1  and IBM JDK 1.7.1. 

I replaced 

maven-3.1.1/boot/plexus-classworlds-2.5.1.jar 

with 

maven-3.0.5/boot/plexus-classworlds-2.4.jar 

ran few builds and there are no issues.

FYI

Which version of the maven release plugin are you using? I'd check with at
least 2.4.2 or 2.5 since known issues with Git have been fixed in those
versions.

Hello,

Over in Apache HBase, we have an interesting problem that I'm hoping the
shade plugin can help us solve. It all started with a performance
enhancement to reduce garbage by creating a subclass of a protobuf type
[0]. It works fine for us most of the time. However, when using this code
from a Hadoop mapreduce job, things get strange. Due to the permissions on
the parent object and the way Hadoop uses "fat" jars, we now have
classloader troubles [1]. We were able to work around the issue by
documenting the required classpath constructions. However, this is not
possible for all users. This is where the shade plugin comes in.

I gave shade a shot [2], though I admit I'm not terribly familiar with it,
nor the inner workings of maven. As far as I can tell, the trouble is the
plugin invocation is limited to the single module in our multi-module
project. I think what's happening is shade is doing what I want for the
hbase-protocol module, but I also need it to do bytecode rewriting for the
modules that consume this module as well. Luckily, this detail is not part
of our public API so it should be transparent to our users.

My patch is posted on [2]. Any pointers/advice is greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance,
Nick

I can't do it - as I said - I'm only writing extension to very big project
which is not mine. And I have to use pom from that "big project". And that
pom has it's own parent and so on... I can't copy and modify all of them. I
just want to create site with some reports for my project regardless of
parent project.

Thanks for the answer, but as I said in the email, I already have a 
module which consists just generated code. However I could not figure 
out how to override settings for the plugin block. Maven by default 
merges the arguments from parent pom. Answer was to use 
combine.self="override" block in the configuration section of the plugin.

Regards,

Niranjan

I am not sure what you mean by "can't".
You can make any POM you want.
You could start by having Maven give you the effective pom from your 
project.
You could save that and make the changes that you require to get your 
site produced to that pom as a standalone project .

Once you have this working you will know which of the master poms is 
giving you the problem so you can get them to change it or figure out 
what you need to override when using their poms.

Hi,

I want to execute a project-less maven plugin from the command line.
However the plugin is not in maven central and I cannot place the plugin
repository in the settings.xml file.

Now I can use the dependency:get plugin to fetch the plugin from the
remote repository into my local repository. However I have to use the
command line switch -llr, which triggers a warning. Otherwise maven
complains about the fact that the plugin cannot be found at maven
central (though it really is in the local repository).

Adding -llr works, and the plugin is found.

However I would like to have a way were I can run a project-less plugin,
from the command line, using an alternate plugin repository.

Like:
    mvn mygroup:myartifact:1.2.3:do-my-stuff
-Dmaven.plugin.repository=http://my.own/repository

I have not found such a property in the documentation.

Jens

You need to have the parent projects available to you in your remote or
local repository. You can't build with them missing because the parent has
configuration which you project (the child) depends upon.

or you can get your plugin build to dump the version into a resource file
and read it at mojo exec time

The Apache Maven team is pleased to announce the release of the Apache Maven 
Plugin Tools, version 3.3

The Maven Plugin Tools contains the necessary tools to be able to produce 
Maven Plugins in scripting languages and to generate rebarbative content like 
descriptor, help and documentation.

The Maven Plugin Plugin is used to create a Maven plugin descriptor for any 
Mojo's found in the source tree, to include in the JAR. It is also used to 
generate report files for the Mojos as well as for updating the plugin 
registry, the artifact metadata and generating a generic help goal.

http://maven.apache.org/plugin-tools/
http://maven.apache.org/plugin-tools/maven-plugin-plugin/

You should specify the version in your project's plugin configuration:

<plugin>
  <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
  <artifactId>maven-plugin-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>3.3</version>
</plugin>


Release Notes - Maven Plugin Tools - Version 3.3

** Bug
    * [MPLUGIN-191] - plugin-info.html is not created
    * [MPLUGIN-234] - Extreme amounts of debug logging
    * [MPLUGIN-235] - Doc example incorrectly states that plexus-utils is 
needed as a dependency
    * [MPLUGIN-236] - Value for Mojo's 'defaultPhase' parameter is incorrectly 
a string in examples
    * [MPLUGIN-239] - Execute goal does not passes from mojos.xml 
pluginMetadata
    * [MPLUGIN-242] - NullPointerException in MojoClassVisitor.visit()
    * [MPLUGIN-244] - Help mojo generates Javadoc, which is not accepted by 
JDK 8 doclint
    * [MPLUGIN-245] - @Parameter property names are not written to the plugin-
help.xml file
    * [MPLUGIN-248] - XML-Namespace in ITs for ant-based mojos are wrong.
    * [MPLUGIN-255] - Generated HelpMojo doesn't close resource stream
    * [MPLUGIN-258] - IT failures with Jdk 8 (EA) 
    * [MPLUGIN-260] - Plugin that uses annotations in Java 8 source can't 
generate descriptor
    * [MPLUGIN-262] - Generated HelpMojo doesn't display default values and 
user properties.

** Improvement
    * [MPLUGIN-237] - JavaDoc WARNING on generated HelpMojo class.
    * [MPLUGIN-246] - Clarify that super class must also use annotations
    * [MPLUGIN-264] - Allow other packaging types

** New Feature
    * [MPLUGIN-259] - @Parameter name="xxx" to set bean property name different 
from class' field

** Task
    * [MPLUGIN-233] - remove InstanciationStrategy enum from annotations
    * [MPLUGIN-265] - remove deprecated API since introduction of 
PluginToolsRequest

** Wish
    * [MPLUGIN-249] - give snippets to show use of expressions to get Maven 
objects
    * [MPLUGIN-250] - since element is not in version 1.0.0 of plugin-
metadata: should create a new version of the descriptor
    * [MPLUGIN-257] - deprecate classical Maven objects as components
    * [MPLUGIN-261] - sort goals in generated plugin.xml

Enjoy,

-The Apache Maven team

All,

I am using Apache Maven 3.1.1 and I am trying to get the list of 
developers stored in my pom.xml by resource filtering.

The structure in my pom.xml looks like:
     <developers>
         <developer>
             <name>Bernd</name>
         </developer>
     </developers>

When I filter by "developer= ${project.developers}" I get "developer= 
[org.apache.maven.model.Developer@78741b96]"
when I try "developer= ${project.developers[0].developer}" I just get 
"developer= ${project.developers[0].developer}"

Eventually I want to get to the name, even better a list of names of the 
developers in the pom.xml.
Is that possible?

Thank you,
-- Bernd

Subject: Version in Mojo

Hi,

i'm new to maven, and now i have the following problem. I have a custom
Mojo, and the Mojo should print the own version stored in the pom.xml of
this mojo. And now i have trouble to get this version. I have tried the
project.version, but this is always the version of the pom, that calls my
Mojo. A easy way, will be when the version is hardcoded, but this is not the
best way, becausae each time when the version is changed (release) i must
change it manually.
Is there a better way to get this version?

Thank you in advance!

I havent used this so this is speculation on my part but supposedly googles=
 jquery-translate will translate your HTML body text

using Bing Translator or Google-api code-key

there is a quick sanity check with isTranslatable( langCode OR language ) s=
o you can test langCode availability before attempting the translate

Your plugin manifest has that info ( look under your jar/META-INF)

Store the version of the plugin in a properties file and load it at runtime..

You need to add/bind the maven-failsafe-plugin to your build:
http://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-failsafe-plugin/usage.html

You also need to adapt the naming of your test files:
http://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-failsafe-plugin/examples/inclusion-exclusion.html

possible ideas:

1. use templating-maven-plugin to copy resource across

2. place the resource into a file and deploy/install as a classifier to be
consumed by B using maven-dependency-plugin

Not possible. You should add the plugin repo to your settings.xml.

If you can't modify your settings.xml (locked by corporate policy or
similar), you can always create your own settings.xml (adding the plugin
repo) and have Maven use that for this execution through the "-s" switch.

Hello,

this is not really Mojo specific.

If you build a JAR with maven you can
include the build number or version with filtered resources, filtering
the source code, as a expanded Variable in the Manifest header or by
copy of META-INF/maven/pom.properties. To any of those information you
can then reference to print it out.

This is an example I use (you need to use a class of your project and
add maven group and artifactID):

    /** Read program version from Manifest or maven properties. */
    private static String getVersion()
    {
        Class me = MyClass.class;
        Package jarPackage = me.getPackage();
        if (jarPackage != null)
        {
            String version = jarPackage.getImplementationVersion();
            if (version != null)
            {
                return version;
            }
        }
        InputStream in =
        me.getClassLoader().getResourceAsStream("META-INF/maven/groupID/artifactID/pom.properties");
        if (in == null) { return "UNKNOWN";}
        try
        {
            Properties p = new Properties();
            p.load(in);
            return p.getProperty("version", "UNKNOWN");
        }
        catch (Exception ignored)
        {
            return "UNKNOWN";
        }
        finally
        {
            try { in.close(); } catch (Exception ignored) { /* ignored
    */ } }
    }

Greetings
Bernd

Is A released after each built-number change or is it a snapshot? In the sna=
pshot case you can add a snapshot dependency and then see the number in the c=
lasspath. Maven will find the latest updates. If you make a release I guess i=
t is easier to use a built parameter passed by Jenkins to both projects in a=
 Pipeline. (Or to actually commit changes to version control, hard to say wi=
thout details).

You could also use the versions-plugin to programmatically bump the dependen=
cy version in project B and then run a second maven invocation to build it.

There isn't anything really official.

The maven-eclipse-plugin doesn't get much love any more these days, but
still works fine for some people.

However you will probably find the m2eclipse experience better.

Other alternatives to consider are other editors.
I've never used NetBeans or IntelliJ but others report good experiences.

Hello, 

i am trying to transfert documentation for an application, which is written using a .odt file, to some doxia process, so i can be sure pdf is the lastest version in the build. 

However, i am facing a surprisingly basic problem: i can't find out how to include an inline image. That is, i can put image before, or after a paragraph, but i can't put it inside a paragraph. I tried xhtml, apt, confluence, twiki, xdoc and markdown. 

Here are my results: 
apt -> there is no way to make an inline image in apt 
confluence -> while the language allows it, and the eclipse confluence parser shows it properly, the image tag is not read by doxia and the wiki code appear as is on the final document. image is properly recognized when inside a paragraph 
twiki -> didn't find a way to make an inline image 
markdown -> image tag is recognized inline, but everything after the tag, in same paragraph, is ignored. 
xhtml -> while verbose, this language does allow inline image. Unfortunately, all inline image are showed above paragraph in the resulting pdf, not inline. 
xdoc -> the parser just doesn't kick in, doxia think it's a docbook and messes everything 

So, my question is simple: how can i put an inline image in a doxia document. Which markup language must i use, and what is the process? 

Best result i got so far was with xhtml, and it looked like this in pdf,

when it should have looked about like this (original open office document):

Sure, i have software vendor's poms in my local repository. But I can't
modify them (mostly because vendor releases new version of poms, so I will
have to change every version of their pom - it doesn't have any sense). And
I can't force vendor to add site configuration to their poms. So I have to
do it in my pom. And I tried various methods and in every one of them maven
tried to download site configuration from parent pom. And I'm trying to
avoid this.

SNAPSHOTS are built for this use case. As long as B is in SNAPSHOT mode, A
can continue pulling the latest.

Hi Paul,

> I am looking for a plugin that can generate HTML from markdown document.

You could write your own plugin that uses Markdownj. Or easier: a groovy
script that does so with groovy-maven-plugin bound to the desired Maven
goal. [1]

Otherwise, Doxia already supports Markdown so maven-site-plugin could work,
couldn't it?

-Curtis

[1] We use this to code generate sources using velocity:

There is nothing official from the Maven itself. There used to be =
competing Maven Eclipse integration from different people here, and =
there has always been the command line generation vs IDE integration. So =
there is no officially blessed integration from the Maven project =
proper.

Also note that M2Eclipse and the maven-eclipse-plugin are not =
compatible. In M2E it specifically looks for project files created with =
the maven-eclipse-plugin and disables them.

Curtis, yes, the site plugin contains the support for the markdown content
but only if you're doing a site. There's no straightforward way (or anyway
that I know of) to take advantage of doxia as part of a project's build
(not the site build).


Cheers,
Paul

If worst comes to worst, modify the POM. It's your local repository. You
can do whatever you want to those files. Perhaps you should start by
removing the parent's pom parent.

Of course, this will be a routine to repeat when you get the vendor's
latest POM.


Cheers,
Paul

For B to query A at *runtime* of B: embed your build numbers in the JAR
manifest.

With the buildnumber-maven-plugin, it's something like this:
https://github.com/scijava/pom-scijava/blob/69b3520e486b2a3d65636833efe230b00f3ea78f/pom.xml#L680
And this:
https://github.com/scijava/pom-scijava/blob/69b3520e486b2a3d65636833efe230b00f3ea78f/pom.xml#L567

Then you can extract the version information out the manifest using Java's
built-in API:
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/jar/JarFile.html#getManifest()
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/index.html?java/util/jar/Manifest.html

To query A at B's *build* time as you request -- i.e., for your Jenkins job
that builds B to query the version of A, to decide whether to even build --
you could use the Jenkins Groovy plugin with the "Poll with a Groovy
script" ScriptTrigger that checks whether the build number changed since
the last build, using the above approach...

But is there some reason it's not good enough to simply have B's build be a
downstream job of A's build?

Regards,
Curtis

Hi Dan,

My team definitely felt the pain of its absence from Central as well.

To avoid the problem, we use this workaround:

    <profile>
      <id>only-eclipse</id>
      <activation>
        <property>
          <name>m2e.version</name>
        </property>
      </activation>
      <build>
        <pluginManagement>
          <plugins>
            <!-- This plugin's configuration is used to store Eclipse m2e
settings
                 only. It has no influence on the Maven build itself. -->
            <plugin>
              <groupId>org.eclipse.m2e</groupId>
              <artifactId>lifecycle-mapping</artifactId>
              <version>1.0.0</version>
              <configuration>
                ...
              </configuration>
            </plugin>
          </plugins>
        </pluginManagement>
      </build>
    </profile>

Beautiful, right? ;-)

-Curtis

What if someone wants to publish site doc for a subset of modules?

Is there any way to filter other than having an extra pom that doesn't list
the extra modules as modules?

Hi Tim,

based on your limited description I guess the problem your facing is  
related to the maven-site-plugin.
IIRC this has already been fixed in the latest version of the  
maven-site-plugin.

Robert

Subject: maven-site-plugin unhappy with jdk 1.8?
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
X-Virus-Checked: Checked by ClamAV on apache.org

I have recently udated my jdk from 1.7 to 1.8.
Now I am having problems with the maven-site-plugin which fails with the 
error:

     Error during page generation: Error rendering Maven report: 
Unsupported targetJdk value '1.8'.

Is there a way to specify a different targetJdk value to the plugin?
Is there a plan to update the plugin to accommodate jdk 1.8?

Thanks,
Andy

AFAIK, the m-site-p itself doesn't have any problem with jdk 8, since i=
t=20
doesn't care about jdk
but from the little trace you give, there seem to be a reporting plugin=
 that=20
is sensitive to jdk 8: yes, some plugins have problems, we track them h=
ere [1]

just look at your error traces and you'll see which report is in cause

MG>GIYF: looks like this is targetJdk attribute from maven-pmd-plugin

The target JDK to analyse based on. Should match the target used in the com=
piler plugin. Valid values are currently 1.3=2C 1.4=2C 1.5 and 1.6.=20
Note: support for 1.6 was added in version 2.3 of this plugin.=20



Parameter:
expression=3D"${targetJdk}

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
X-Virus-Checked: Checked by ClamAV on apache.org

Hi,

I wrote a custom plugin that processes some resources inside my project.
Some of them are filtered before my plugin get executed. However, I don't
know how my plugin can process the filtered resource. Currently, it could
only read the raw resource.

I would like to know how my custom plugin can get the filtered version of
any resource.

Can you help me ?

Thanks !

You need to read them from the target folder.

Ok. I wanted to know if it's possible to handle them before they get written
to the target directory.

Seems to not be the case so I'll chose the naive approach.

Thanks for the reply!

Hi Alejandro,

I know what you are talking about and was facing the same trouble with=20
maven.
This is why I wrote flatten-maven-plugin.
You might want to wait for beta-2 to get startet, but you could already=20
give it a try if you want.
To be warned:
http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MOJO-2030

Cheers
   J=F6rg

If you just use the Eclipse/STS delivered by the Spring team, you get 
everything that you need to use Maven without worrying about plug-ins.

A solution like this, is what I would like to replace, actually. :-)

What we have, is:
 - A jar that is built with maven, and installed in the local plexus
   archive, this Jar file creates an excel file from a template
 - Many jenkins projects that uses the jar together with two python
   scrips
 - The python scripts, are:
  - A script to delete existing XLS files in the working directory
  - A script to download the jar from plexus

What I would like to have, are maven projects that would:
 1. Have the jar project as a dependency
 2. Run the jar to create the XLS spreadsheet in the target directory
 3. Offer the the XLS spreadsheet in the target directory as a Jenkins
    build artifact

Ie. since the python scripts does things that maven does by default
(clean the working directory, and download jar files from plexus),
replacing them with a maven project seemed like a good idea.

Hi all,

*TL;DR: does anyone use the parallelThreads option in maven-invoker-plugin?
Do you also have issues with concurrent local repository access? If so, how
do you solve them?*

I've recently come across the parallelThreads option in
maven-invoker-plugin. After having tried to use it a few times, I'm
currently stuck.

It fails randomly, and not surprisingly it seems like it comes from the
fact the local-repo is shared between ITs. While downloading from the MRM,
there's always one jars that fails to be written to the disk because of a
likely concurrent access.

My first thought was to try and have a separate localRepository per IT. But
I can't find a property or even a workaround to do that.

Because filing an issue to m-invoker-p, I wanted to check here if I was
missing something.

Thanks for your help.

AFIK this is one is unsolved. We have a number of kludges that involve
resolving all the required deps to the local repository *before*
starting the parallel process, at least 2 og 3 projects do it this
way. As far as I understand solving concurrent thread safe repo in the
latest maven version should be trivial, but it needs to be solved in
the core.

Yup, I know this work is still underway, no problem. I realize I wasn't
clear enough (and my TL;DR may have been be misleading).

I was also wondering if there was a workaround where you could define a
specific path *per it* for the local repository. But unfortunately from a
quick look at InvokerMojo.java I don't think it is possible.

Thanks for your feedback.

Eh you might be able to...

you could have the "local repo" that m-i-p "installs" into be a "remote"
repo in your settings.xml (along with the mrm repo) and then use ${basedir}
in the localrepo path...

(Untested)

Can you post a sample nonworking project online please? GitHub as a project
or Gist, or pastebin, or similar. Otherwise there is not enough information
to diagnose.

Hi Baptiste,

I'm working often with maven-invoker and have found an issue with 
parallelThreads option (http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MINVOKER-147).

The local shared repos is also a problem.

The should be something like a repo per IT...

Kind regards
Karl-Heinz Marbaise

Ave!

I've a problem with mvn release:perform, which fails on invalid POM and
cuts of it's dependencies giving me compilation failure later


*EVEN THOUGH POM is valid.*I've arrived here via:
http://maven.apache.org/maven-release/maven-release-plugin/mail-lists.html

Full problem description is available at SO:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23546159/false-compile-error-during-mvn-releaseperform-says-invalid-pom-while-pom-is-fin

I'm quite puzzled what's going on, any pointers are welcome.

pozdrawiam,
LAFK

Is there a way to have Invoker run a test with more than one thread (i.e.
the -T option)?  My understanding is that the 'invoker.parallelThreads'
option is to run Invoker itself in parallel across test poms, but that each
individual test pom is still single threaded.  Or am I misunderstanding?

IIUC your proposition is to play with defining <localRepository /> value to
variabilize the value with the current project?
Unfortunately I don't think this is gonna work since <localRepository /> is
actually totally ignored by design. You define <localRepositoryPath> once
directly in the m-invoker-p configuration block in the pom.xml.

Thanks Karl-Heinz. My current understanding is indeed that this option is
very attractive at first, but cannot currently work in practice. Having had
a quick in the code, I didn't see any IT testing this property. I'll keep

Thanks

Actually, after reading the code a bit, I'm 90% sure this isn't supported
and I'm not misinterpreting the purpose of invoker.parallelThreads.  I've
opened a Jira for this (http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MINVOKER-165).  If
I get a chance, I might see if I can put a patch together.

i have had better luck in recent years with maven-dependency-plugin
creating a classpath pointing to the ~/.m2 artifacts versus uberjar, shade,
and assembly.  not every production app can build a maven app in place to
run, but where it can a) startup can be faster using test "target/" to skip
compile on rerun and b) dep version collisions and mismatches are easier to
trace into using said classpath

hi,

what the release:perform is not more then:
- check out the tag to target/checkout
- run 'mvn deploy' from this directory

so please verify the content of the target/checkout directory and try to  
run 'mvn deploy' from this directory.
that should give you a hint what went wrong.

thanks,
Robert

Hi All,

Is there a mechanism available to publish maven site documentation to 
google sites ?

Presumably this would be in the form of a wagon that would use the 
google api to insert html to the right google sites page. However, I 
couldn't find anything already built in this area.

Ideas welcome :-)

Thanks,

Pete

In general, I agree with you regarding the perils of this "fat jar"
approach. However, due to legacy reasons, this is a feature that we must
support. Give this context, is there any advice regarding how to use the
shade plugin to rewrite all references to the moved class in dependent
submodules? Is this a feature the share plugin supports? Assuming this is a
reasonable use of the shade plugin, we have a willingness to contribute a
patch.

Thank you for the replies.
Nick

I explained in this short blog post how MySQL can be used in integration
testing with Maven:

The Apache Maven team is pleased to announce the release of the Apache Maven 
SCM Publish Plugin, version 1.1

This plugin is a utility plugin to allow publishing Maven website to any 
supported SCM. The primary goal was to have an utility plugin to allow Apache 
projects to publish Maven websites via the ASF svnpubsub system. The plugin 
has been tested with git scm too and by example can push content for github 
pages.

http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-scm-publish-plugin/

You should specify the version in your project's plugin configuration:

<plugin>
  <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
  <artifactId>maven-scm-publish-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>1.1</version>
</plugin>

Release Notes - Maven SCM Publish Plugin - Version 1.1

** Bug
    * [MSCMPUB-12] - scmBranch ignored when tryUpdate is specified

** Improvement
    * [MSCMPUB-15] - log files and directories added/deleted as INFO

** New Feature
    * [MSCMPUB-14] - add all directories in 1 command per default

Enjoy,

-The Apache Maven team

The resulting pom should look like (as normal)
...
	<groupId>${groupId}</groupId>
	<artifactId>${artifactId}</artifactId>
	<version>${version}</version>
...
	<scm>
	
<developerConnection>scm:svn:http://myserver.com/${groupIdManipulated}/trunk${artifactId}</developerConnection>
	</scm>

Is this possible? I have tried the gmaven-plugin, but this only manipulated
the groupId of the archtype. But i want to manipulate the groupId for the
new project when using this archetype.

<execution>
  <phase>initialize</phase>
  <goals>
    <goal>execute</goal>
  </goals>
  <configuration>
   <source>
    project.properties["groupIdManipulated"] =
"${project.groupId}".replace('.', '-')
   </source>
  </configuration>
</execution>

Imho you should not be using the Maven Ant tasks since they are using Maven 2 internally and you are most likely using Maven 3. Maven 3 uses Eclipse Aether and there are Aether Ant Tasks that probably do what you want to use the Maven Ant tasks for. 

Check it out at

Hi,
The Mojo team is pleased to announce the release of the FindBugs Maven
Plugin version 2.5.4.
FindBugs uses static analysis to inspect Java bytecode for occurrences
of bug patterns.

To get this update, simply specify the version in your project's
plugin configuration:

<plugin>
        <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
        <artifactId>findbugs-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>2.5.4</version>
</plugin>

We solved the following issues:

Release Notes - Mojo's FindBugs Maven Plugin - Version 2.5.4



** Bug
    * [MFINDBUGS-189] - The plugin generates reports incompatible with
the 'maven-jxr-plugin' version 2.4.



** Improvement
    * [MFINDBUGS-195] - Update to Findbugs 2.0.3


Enjoy,


Garvin LeClaire

I encounter a problem that testing doesn't get executed. Searching on
the internet, people say that ceoms from old junit version suppressing
the newer one. Checking with -X some plugin looks suspicious.

I tried to add tag excluding junit with old version in those plugins

    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.codehaus.plexus</groupId>
      <artifactId>plexus-container-default</artifactId>
      <version>1.0-alpha-9-stable-1</version>
      <exclusions>
        <exclusion>
          <groupId>junit</groupId>
          <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
      </exclusions>
    </dependency>

but does not working.

Is there any place I can check for finding the possible root cause? Or
what additional tag need to be added for fixing this problem?

Thanks.

So there is an error in the official maven documentation at
http://maven.apache.org/pom.html#Plugin_Management, quoting 

> *If we added these specifications to the plugins element, they would apply
> only to a single POM.*  
> However, if we apply them under the pluginManagement element, then this

It is talking about a plugin configuration, but it is not right to state
that adding "plugin" specifications to the "plugins" elements would apply
only *to a single POM*, as adding it to the parent would apply to the parent
and all the childs inheriting from it.

This is confirmed by Wayne Fay post where he indicates the difference of
'pluginManagement' over 'plugins':

> The plugins declared in the build section of your parent will be 
> inherited (and executed) in all of those children poms. In many cases, 
> you might only want a given plugin to actually be used in a few of 
> those children, or even just one, and frequently not in the parent. 

I think that the documentation should say something like this in that
paragraph:

"If we added these specifications to the parent's build/plugins element,
they would apply to the parent and all the inheriting childs which isn't
usually the expected behaviour. However, if we apply them under the parent's
pluginManagement element, then parent's POM and/or inheriting POMs that
added the maven-jar-plugin to the build as shown below will get the
pre-process-classes execution."

Subject: Affecting configuration of a sibling POM

Hi,

I have a case where a sibling POM (both POMs have the same parent) needs to
have a different configuration plugin for the maven-war plugin.
Specifically, I need to put the <attachClasses>true</attachClasses> element
into the configuration. The problem is that I cannot override or modify
this POM. Other acceptable solutions would be to build this particular
project with a command-line property or through some kind of aggregated
POM, as long as I can specify the option without modifying this POM itself.

I've scoured the internet for a solution and the only thing I've really
found is passing a property in via command line. But this apparently only
works for properties which have an expression defined. attachClasses does
not have this.

Too much work to do. I think that I'd better find other way to create reports
I need. 

So Mr "maven-site-plugin" - i don't like you anymore :)

I've narrowed down the problem to jcl-over-slf4j.

    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
      <artifactId>jcl-over-slf4j</artifactId>
      <version>1.7.5</version>
    </dependency>

When it's commented out, the test case will be executed, but not when
it's listed in dependency section.

I also have scalatest 2.10 and junit 4.8.1 in the dependency section.

    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.scalatest</groupId>
      <artifactId>scalatest_2.10</artifactId>
      <version>2.0</version>
      <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>

      <dependency>
        <groupId>junit</groupId>
        <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
        <version>4.8.1</version>
      </dependency>


What's common/ possible factors that may affect if test cases will be executed?

I appreciate any suggestions.

So both projects have attachClasses=true set, and you want to change one of
that config at command line?

Hi,
That's not it. The only POM I can modify in this situation is my own POM,
which needs to have a dependency on this sibling POM. The problem is that
the sibling POM only generates a .war file, which can't be used as a
dependency. Changing attachClasses to true would fix this of course, but I
can't modify the POM directly. I can however, change the command I use to
build this sibling project, or change anything in my own POM.

The structure is thus:

Parent
--- Sibling that generates .war files
--- My project

I want to make the sibling attach some classes, so I can use it as a
dependency in my own project.

Subject: unit tests with multiple oracle, db2 etc

We have to begin running junit tests using more than 1 database type. I am
wondering how best to run all unit tests using oracle then run all of the
tests again using db2 then postgres. I figured some of you out there must
have a similar requirement.

Currently we have test/resources/test-context.xml that contains
    <bean id="dataSource"
        class="org.apache.commons.dbcp.BasicDataSource"
        destroy-method="close" lazy-init="true">
        <property name="driverClassName"
value="com.p6spy.engine.spy.P6SpyDriver" />
        <property name="url" value="jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:xxxx"
/>
        <property name="username" value="xxxxx" />
        <property name="password" value="xxxxx" />
        <property name="accessToUnderlyingConnectionAllowed" value="true" />
        <property name="defaultAutoCommit" value="false" />
        <property name="maxWait" value="0" />
        <property name="maxActive" value="-1" />
    </bean>

There is nothing in the pom.xml explicitly related to unit tests other than
        <dependency>
            <groupId>junit</groupId>
            <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
            <version>4.8.2</version>
        </dependency>

Quick sanity builds are done by our CI system using
mvn package -e -Dmaen.test.skip=true
Due to how long the tests take to complete they are only run daily using
mvn test -e -Dtest=com.zafinlabs.someapp.somemodule.TestSomeProcess

Suggestions please.

This sounds weird that you cant change the pom which is a sibling of yours,
and I dont want to get into that ...

any way, you are stuck, unless you get permission to make that setting
configurable

It is a very specific case, yes. And technically I can change it if I
really need to. It's an open source project which we are trying to avoid
making changes to the upstream version in this particular case, because it
doesn't need to be a jar file for the mainline. We just want to override it
internally. In the end it's probably just going to be a local patch that we
keep on our own branch.

Thanks for the help.

To stop making avoidable mistakes in project management one can also try
attending good  PMP classes <http://www.PMstudy.com/>   conducted by any of
the PMI registered REP's for gainig expertise best processes of project
management. Any good  PMP prep course <http://www.PMstudy.com/>   will
provide students with lots of actionable insights in project management
along with preparing them for PMP certification.

Anders' suggestion sounds very logical

however, i found this at super pom

  <repositories>
    <repository>
      <id>central</id>
      <name>Central Repository</name>
      <url>http://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2</url>

    </repository>
  </repositories>

  <pluginRepositories>
    <pluginRepository>
      <id>central</id>

      </snapshots>
      <releases>
        <updatePolicy>never</updatePolicy>
      </releases>
    </pluginRepository>
  </pluginRepositories>

Is there a way to disable/clear out the super pom pluginRepositories?
If I add my own pluginRepositories, will it override the super pom
one?

It will if you use the same id, ie 'central'.

Well first off, this is really an integration test... So I would switch to
have failsafe run the tests: ie add failsafe:integration-test and
failsafe:verify to your project's lifecycle (perhaps even in a profile)

Then I would use
http://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-failsafe-plugin/integration-test-mojo.html#additionalClasspathElementsin
multiple executions of the failsafe:integration-test config to add the
different directories for each environment that you want to test against

So you would have:

* an execution of failsafe:verify bound to the verify phase to check all
the aggregate results
* an execution of failsafe:integration-test bound to the integration-test
phase with additionalClasspathElements pointing to
src/test/oracle-resources which has a test-context.xml pointing to the
oracle DB
* an execution of failsafe:integration-test bound to the integration-test
phase with additionalClasspathElements pointing to src/test/db2-resources
which has a test-context.xml pointing to the DB2 DB.
Etc

It's not completely ideal in that you are hard-coding the DB connection
detail in source control... If I were doing it I would seek to either only
enable the DB-specific integration tests based on the existence of the
corresponding test-context.xml (profile activation) source control would
have a test-config.xml.template and ignore the test-config.xml so that I
can have my own local test env that is separate from yours and we are not
fighting over who's test-config.xml to merge... Or I would use resource
filtering to inject the config by properties (activating the profile based
on the presence of the property). The second route would probably be more
verbose so I would probably write a helper plugin... Haven't needed to do
that yet, hence I haven't written such a plugin ;-)

I got some thing working

1. at my repo manager, create a proxy, called plugin-central, to host
another central.maven.org/maven2
2. reconfigure my global settings.xml with the following contents. Please
help to review this content

ArtifactResolver has been deprecated but it doesn't provide guidance on an
appropriate replacement.

In the spirit of trying to move in the right direction what should I use
instead?

Subject: Maven dependency plugin - stripClassifier
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
X-Virus-Checked: Checked by ClamAV on apache.org

Hi to all, 

i have the following trouble when using the maven dependency plugin, and
especially the unpack-dependencies.
I have 3 different dependencies test1, test2, and tes3, and i would like to
unpack each dependency into separate folder as example into test1, test2,
etc.  Therefor i use the option useSubDirectoryPerArtifact, but the problem
is that this option create a direcory with the artifactId and the
Classifier. When i set stripClassifier to false, it has no effect.
If this doesn't work, i can include each artifact manually, but this is not
a very good solution, when i have 10 dependencies.

Thank you in advance!

Hi,

I am trying to build an API documentation for some eclipse plugins.
Therefore I'd like to run the Javadoc:aggregate goal

My configuration therefore is trivial:

	<build>
		<plugins>
			<plugin>
	
<artifactId>maven-javadoc-plugin</artifactId>
				<version>2.9.1</version>
				<configuration>
	
<reportOutputDirectory>help/api</reportOutputDirectory>
					<destDir>api</destDir>
				</configuration>
			</plugin>
		</plugins>
	</build>

Now maven fails as it cannot resolve lots of eclipse dependencies like:

[ERROR] Failed to execute goal
org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-javadoc-plugin:2.9.1:aggregate (default-cli)
on project com.infineon.commontools.releng.jenkins: An error has occurred in
JavaDocs report generation:
[ERROR] Exit code: 1 -
C:\Userdata\Workspaces\SysBox\ebt_common\bundles\com.infineon.tools\src\com\
infineon\tools\AbstractActivator.java:24: error: package org.eclipse.ui does
not exist
[ERROR] import org.eclipse.ui.IMemento;
[ERROR] ^

I get other errors for libs, where I only have a binary OSGI bundle
available (which is part of the aggregator pom)

[ERROR] symbol:   class CoreException
[ERROR] location: class StringTools
[ERROR]
C:\Userdata\Workspaces\SysBox\ebt_common\bundles\com.infineon.tools\src\com\
infineon\tools\hexparser\antlr\HexStringBaseListener.java:4: error: package
org.antlr.v4.runtime does not exist
[ERROR] import org.antlr.v4.runtime.ParserRuleContext;
[ERROR] ^


Generally I am happy with the created JavaDoc files. Is there a way to tell
Javadoc to ignore missing dependencies or to tell maven not to fail here?
I know there are lots of similar questions asked out there, but I could not
find a solution to my problem

Thanks
Christian

For my solution on this topic I didn't declare a mirror for

I does not add anything as it is only a mirror for one repo.

Hi Ander

that makes sense

now i only have

 <mirrors>
    <mirror>
      <id>product-repo</id>
      <mirrorOf>*,!plugin-central</mirrorOf>
      <name>Internal Maven Repository Manager</name>
      <url>http://repos.xxx.com:8081/nexus/content/groups/public</url>
    </mirror>
  </mirrors>


Also, do i need to redefine 'central'  it looks redundant to me

Thanks

-D

It's best-practice IMO. It ensures that the central definition declared in
the super-POM is overwritten with a dummy (not working) URL. It will/should
then be handled by the mirror so that it is redirected to the internal
mirror. If, for any reason, the mirror definition is removed or not
correctly declared you will then quickly noticed this as your Maven build
will not work (as the calls to 'central' will fail).

Subject: how maven build plugins plugin use latest version
From: Sartisty <sartisty@gmail.com>

hi, all,
I have developed a maven build plugin and I will upgrade it
frequently. How to use the latest release version, not modify plugin
version in pom.xml frequently? One idea is no version setting, but it
will generate too much warnings. Setting LATEST, it won't work.

Subject: Android Maven Plugin 3.9.0-rc.2 released - on the road to 4.0.0!
From: "Manfred Moser" <manfred@mosabuam.com>
To: users@maven.apache.org
Message-Id: <20140528060925.E860143431DD@dd34514.kasserver.com>
Date: Wed, 28 May 2014 08:09:25 +0200 (CEST)
X-Virus-Checked: Checked by ClamAV on apache.org

The Android Maven Plugin team is pleased to announce the release of version 3.9.0-rc.2 of the plugin. 

The list of changes for the version is long and full of great enhancements. Major changes are the full support for aar (Android Archive) creation and consumption combined with the support for Maven 3.0.4 and higher. This should allow tools to like Android Studio that are still stuck on old Maven versions to better support the Android Maven Plugin.

Going forward we plan to cut a 4.0.0 release after a brief testing period of this release pulling in only minor fixes and enhancements. Please test this version thoroughly and report issues on github at https://github.com/jayway/maven-android-plugin/issues

New features/bug fixes are

- Path issues fix for proguard mojo usage on Windows
- Removed duplicate dependencies in native sample projects
- Changed from direct Aether usage to Dependency Tree usage allowing compatibility with Maven 3.0.x and therefore with IDE's and other tools that have old Maven version like this embedded
- Allow to specify the number of threads used in device operations to avoid issues with lots of attached devices
- New goals to connect and disconnect devices specified by IP number for all device interactions
- Log message fix
- Avoid attempt to include R.txt in AAR if it doesnt exist
- Remove META-INF from AAR
- include groupId in native artifact resolution transitive dependencies not dependent on existence of local natives dir
- Check for duplicate package name in android artifacts and produce warnings
- Fixed logging level for AIDL files in GenerateSourcesMojo
- Improved handling of transitive native dependencies
- Refactored usage of maven-plugin-plugin annotations to remove usage of deprecated expression
- Verbose output from aapt tool when Maven plugin config set to debug logging
- Added support for configuring adb connection timeout
- Improve AndroidManifest update to work with non-ascii characters
- Include BuildConfig class in aar 
- Preserve order of dependencies for native dependency resolution
- Adapted Travis build config to new SDK setup/distribution
- Removed hardcoded debuggable setting from examples
- Changed a couple of log levels
- Consolidated aapt command invocations in one builder style class
- New property for android.aidlSourceDirectory to allow aidl source in different folder from rest of source
- Allow android:run to proceed through a multi module build just like other device interaction goals
- Taking reactor projects into account for resolving dependency tree of aar packages including taking into account wagon extensions
- Fixed the construction of R.java files for the dependencies of an APK
- Fail build if project + dependencies have more than one layout file of the same name
- Fail build if duplicate packages in AndroidManifest files for project and dependencies are detected
- Provided scope dependencies get unpacked, improves instrumentation test runs
- Use build extensions classloader if exists https://github.com/jayway/maven-android-plugin/pull/366
- Samples libraryprojects/libraryprojects-tests failure fixed
- POM cleanup
- Improved error message for missing dependencies
- Added the now required scope "provided" for the apk under instrumentation test
- Fix up samples to work with the now stricter check on duplicate package usage

When upgrading please ensure to check the change log for further details:

Hi,
This is not possible with maven by design. It has to do with the "build
reproducibility" thing you'll often read here.

I think there were a recent thread about that very question, also have a
look at it if you will.

Cheers

Hi Sartisty,

> How to use the latest release version, not modify plugin version in
> pom.xml frequently?

Why not just keep it as an eternal 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT or some such? Then you'll
never have to change the POMs that use it.

But as Baptiste points out, all of those downstream projects will sacrifice
build reproducibility. Imagine that you accidentally introduce a bug into
your build plugin which starts failing the build erroneously. Then
suddenly, projects which use that plugin might have failing builds with no
code changes. Release tags that built yesterday will no longer build. Not a
good situation!

Regards,
Curtis

Subject: Maven release plugin having trouble with transformations?
From: Laird Nelson <ljnelson@gmail.com>

Content-Type: multipart/alternative; boundary=001a11c2cd28e50cec04fa92a0dd

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

This is very puzzling.

For years I've used the maven-release-plugin to automate my releases with
no trouble.

Now, on a particular project on GitHub, it is incorrectly transforming my
pom.xml and attempting to release the project as a snapshot.

The project is drop-dead brainlessly simple.  It is a single-module project.

The version is of the form 1.X.X-SNAPSHOT to start with.  Let's say it's at
1.0.3-SNAPSHOT.

I run mvn release:prepare and answer all the prompts with the defaults, as
I have for years.  It correctly surmises that the release version should be
1.0.3 and the new dev version should be 1.0.4-SNAPSHOT.

It then transforms the pom.xml (apparently), and (apparently) tags the repo.

When I investigate the release.properties file, it looks OK.

However, when I look at the contents of the tag just created, it has the
wrong version in it (1.0.3-SNAPSHOT).  I've tried this back to back, and
sometimes the tag has really random old versions: it's almost like the git
checkout command that the release plugin issues is checking out the wrong
branch or otherwise screwing things up--and all of a sudden, for no
discernible reason.

When I then do a release:perform, what gets mvn deploy'ed is a snapshot
version instead of the expected release version.  Investigating
target/checkout shows that the wrong branch--or perhaps the "right"
branch/tag with the wrong contents--is what was "perform"ed on.

This behavior has never happened to me before and I have not added any
settings or changed anything.  I'm using Maven 3.0.5, the release plugin
version 2.4.2 and Apple git 1.8.5.2.  Completely stumped.

This is really just a plea for help with shotgunning in the dark; has
anyone observed behavior remotely like this before?

Thanks,
Best,
Laird

Whittling this down a bit, it looks like the transformation works properly,
because after transformation, the release plugin runs a build, and I can
see in that build that the version is correct (i.e. non-SNAPSHOT).

It appears to be in what is selected for tagging.  The thing that is tagged
(and then checked out later, and then released/deployed) is my original
development pom.xml.

It is as though the transformation is not being committed properly, or that
the tag is being misapplied.  All the other mysterious screwed-up behavior
descends from here.

What could account for this?  Why now?  Is there something GitHub-related
that might have changed (though that seems wrong)?

Best,
Laird

And the inclusion of  <fileNameMapping>no-version</fileNameMapping> which I

Sure enough, I'm never seeing a git commit operation (with -X turned on).
 How can I get commits to start working again?  Am I overlooking an option?

Upgrading the maven-release-plugin version to 2.5 caused commit operations
to start being issued again and I was (finally) able to perform a release
in the same way I've been performing them for years prior.

Other readers: do kindly check your own maven-release-plugin version
stanzas and make sure you're not using version 2.4.2.  When operating the
Apple git client, commits are never sent and you will release the wrong
thing with no errors.

Best,
Laird

You can't do exactly what you are aiming to do dynamically but you could
hard code that structure into your pom's.

Look into the property;

project.build.directory

If you defined that in the respective pom's as below;

project.build.directory=/tmp/grandfarther/target
project.build.directory=/tmp/grandfarther/farther/target
project.build.directory=/tmp/grandfarther/farther/son/target

in the respective pom's you could create the structure your after.

Because grandfarther, farther, son are arbitrary directory names and maven
doesn't care what it's currently directory name is and only modules
configuration only needs to point to a directory with a pom in.

Another question is why do you want/need this structure as i often find the
answer to that the real root cause.

John

So my question to this is: Why do want to do this? What's the reason to 
use a folder outside the modules ? Can you explain your use case and why 
you need it such that way and can't stuck with the conventions 
project/target ?

Kind regards

So I'm guessing you then have mapped tmp to a ram drive, otherwise tmp will
still be on your SSD unless you also have a non-SSD too which is mapped to
tmp.

Honestly as long as it's a new ish SSD, your not writing GB and GB per hour
constantly 24/7, your SSD is under about 60% full then I would not worry
that much.

They are designed to wear the drive evenly which is an issue if you want to
get ride of the SSD as dban won't correctly scrub the disk as the disk lies
about which sector is being written too.

My development laptop is 12 months old with a 512GB SSD, about 50% full and
I'm doing several builds an hour, with one full clean install per hour and
I'm expecting it to last lots more years before it dies.

Hi,

 

This has probably been answered before, but I haven't been able to find the
answer and I'm hoping someone knows.

 

I'm writing several apps that talk to a Microsoft SQL database, so I'm using
the Hibernate dependency. Since Microsoft doesn't make the sqljdbc4 jar
available on Maven, I've downloaded it, and I'm trying to make it an
unmanaged dependency in its own standalone project so that I can simply
reference it in other projects' pom files without having to deploy the jar
to each one individually.

 

I've followed the instructions for deploying an unmanaged dependency. As I
am the only developer at my company (at this time), I do not have a separate
Maven server setup. I was hoping to simply deploy the dependency and then
run 'maven install' so that it copies everything needed into my .m2 folder.
This is my directory setup:

 

(This is the project directory for the sqljdbc4 unmanaged dependency)

C:\dev\Github-repos\addons\sqljdbc4

  +- pom.xml

  +-src

  +-repo

 

I followed the instructions to use mvn deploy on the local sqljdbc4.jar
file. I am using an artifactId of sqljdbc4, version 4.0, groupId of
com.microsoft.sqlserver. After deployment, the repo directory does appear to
be correctly populated:

 

C:\dev\Github-repos\addons\sqljdbc4

  +- pom.xml

  +-src

  +-repo

       +-com

           +-microsoft

                  +-sqlserver

                       +-sqljdbc4

                                +-maven-metadata

                                +-4.0

                                      +-sqljdbc4-4.0.jar

                                      +-sqljdbc4-4.0.pom

 

Next, following the instructions, I go back into the pom.xml file and add
the repository tag, so my pom.xml for this now looks like:

 

<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0
http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd
<http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0%20http:/maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.
xsd> ">

  <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>

  <groupId>com.microsoft.sqlserver</groupId>

  <artifactId>sqljdbc4</artifactId>

  <version>4.0</version>

  

<repositories>

    <!--other repositories if any-->

    <repository>

        <id>project.local</id>

        <name>project</name>

        <url>file:${project.basedir}/repo</url>

    </repository>

</repositories>

</project>

 

 

Now, here is the problem. Since I want to use this as a dependency in other
projects, I am trying to run 'maven install' so that it will push everything
into my .m2 directory. The maven build is a success. However, the resulting
sqljdbc4.jar file in the target directory and up in the m2 directory is only
2kb (whereas the original jar file is 571kb, none of the content made it
in). As a result, projects that use this as a dependency build, but then
throw a ClassNotFoundException at runtime, because the classes aren't there.

 

I am building a separate project that uses this as a dependency:

 

C:\dev\Github-repos\applications\myapp

 

The pom.xml for this project uses the dependency correctly:

<dependency>

                <groupId>com.microsoft.sqlserver</groupId>

                <artifactId>sqljdbc4</artifactId>

                <version>4.0</version>

</dependency>

 

I'm even using the maven assembly plugin to ensure a jar is built with all
dependencies packaged in:

 

                    <plugin>

 
<artifactId>maven-assembly-plugin</artifactId>

                                  <configuration>

                                                <descriptorRefs>

 
<descriptorRef>jar-with-dependencies</descriptorRef>

                                                </descriptorRefs>

                                    <archive>

                                      <manifest>

                                        <addClasspath>true</addClasspath>

 
<mainClass>productfeeds.main.ProductFeedDriver</mainClass>

                                      </manifest>

                                    </archive>

                                  </configuration>

        <executions>

          <execution>

            <phase>package</phase>

            <goals>

              <goal>single</goal>

            </goals>

          </execution>

        </executions>

                                </plugin>

 

 

Any ideas what I'm doing wrong? I'm sure it's something really simple I've
overlooked. If I don't make this a standalone dependency, and simply use
'mvn install:install-file -Dfile=sqljdbc4.jar
-DgroupId=com.microsoft.sqlserver -DartifactId=sqljdbc4 -Dversion=4.0
-Dpackaging=jar ', then everything works fine.

 

Thanks,

 

Matt

Hi Matt,

Have you seen this article?
http://developer-blog.cloudbees.com/2013/03/playing-trade-offs-with-maven.html

If you cannot deploy the Microsoft JARs to your own internal Maven
repository, then you could try the non-maven-jar-plugin approach. It is
strongly recommended over the "basedir repository hack" approach that you
are using (presumably from
https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/local-maven-dependencies).

Regards,
Curtis

I don't think you should make a project for your sql jar. My guess is when
you build+install that, you're creating an empty and useless jar file and
overwriting the good one you already placed in your local repo. The
mvn:install:install-file thing works and is what I would expect as the
answer.


Cheers,
Paul

Hi Curtis,

I'll take a look at that, thanks! Ideally, I'll eventually be able to have an
internal Maven repository
so that I can do everything right. What I had been trying to do in the meantime
is having it set up
so that when we set up a new development station, the user can simply clone the
Github repo that
has these dependency projects and just do 'mvn install' on each one, then build
or develop the
standalone app(s). Kinda  crude I know, but we're basically just starting a
software development
department, so have to work  with what's available in the short-term. If it
doesn't work, I can just
keep a batch script with the jar  that runs the mvn:install I suppose.

Yup Paul, that's exactly what was happening. The jar file deployed into a local
repo within the
project directory, and put a reference pom file up in the .m2 directory. But as
soon as I
ran 'mvn install', it built an empty jar file and put that up in the .m2
instead. I just wanted to try to
have it in a separate project so that from the user's perspective, it would be
as close as possible
to what the process would be  if we had an actual internal maven repo.

Thanks for the suggestions everyone!

Matt

the correct solution; that is how you get it into your local repo without
downloading it from a remote repo.

The install-file is the way to go and it will be successful as soon as your
work on  your machine.
If you want to distributed setup, then you must upload the JAR to a
repository manager or install it on a shared maven repository and use that
remote maven repository in your POM files

Arguably if you insist on this "mvn install" approach, you could unzip
the jar contents into src/main/resources. Then when you "build" it
would copy everything into /target and build a "new" jar file which
would be installed.

But this is really not the right approach. You should be using
install:install-file.
