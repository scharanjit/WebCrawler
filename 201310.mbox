Subject: maven shade: how to actually use custom shader (plus a few ideas)

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

First the question: how do I actually use a custom shader? I've created my
own Shader implementation based on DefaultShader, set a new hint, and
modified the working pom.xml entry with
<shaderHint>myShaderHint</shaderHint>.

It blows up - it can't find a class implementing the Shader interface. I
KNOW that that class is present, I don't know why it can't find it. I also
tried adding <shader implementation="fully.qualified.class.Name"/>. No joy
there either.

So how do I specify the custom shader???

Now two ideas. I would contribute code but my employer is rather paranoid
so my hands are tied until the end of my contract. Fortunately these are
simple ideas that would only take a few hours for someone familiar with the
code to knock out.

1. Add "artifact" to ShadeRequest. This lets the custom shader to make a
distinction between "internal" dependencies and "external" dependencies.

2. Add a standard Shader that creates a jar-of-jars instead of an uberjar.

The specific motivation for the jar-of-jars is that we need to collect
dependencies for third-party vulnerability assessment. We've been doing it
by hand but it's very error prone. With a trivial change to DefaultShader
we can immediately create a jar containing all of the dependencies. We can
then upload that monster for assessment.

(The ability to capture the corresponding source is a free additional
benefit!)

3. We're trying to implement a refinement of the second item. The specs are
still in flux but the idea is that anything "internal" (same groupId) goes
in the parent directory but is stripped of version information. Everything
else goes into a "lib" directory. Again the idea is that it makes it much
easier to pass to a third-party validation tool. I don't know if this is
too specific for a general tool or if it's something easily supported with
a configuration flag or two.

Thanks,

Bear

Are you adding the dependency with the custom shader as a *dependency of
the plugin*?

i.e.

in xpath you'd be creating a code

/project/build/plugins/plugin/dependencies/dependency

and that node would specify the artifact that has your custom shader
implementation

Not sure I'm getting the need for this... to be honest it smells like
you've gone down a rabbit hole with one way of thinking and you might be
better served taking a different tack... but please explain your thinking.

I think the assembly plugin can do exactly this for you.

We'd like to keep plugins close to single principle as we can, so
replicating a load of features from the assembly plugin into the shade
plugin feels like an anti-pattern to me. From my point of view shade should
be for shading.

I'll pass that back up the food chain. I'm sure we've discussed using
assembly but it was rejected. It wouldn't surprise me if one person
specified dependencies by hand and everyone's just followed what worked.

Hi,

Continuing with this issue, I'll describe one more unexpected behaviour I'm
facing in my project.

Just to describe the project, its a kind of plugin-project that has an
implementation that should be hidden from
the developer that uses the plugin,  so my project contains these poms

- main pom (should be deployed/installed)
- API pom contains the API for the plugin (should be deployed/installed)
- SPI pom contains the implementation (should NOT be deployed/installed)
- INTEGRATION-TEST test the plugin as a plugin (should NOT be
deployed/installed)

So after Robert answer I just made the integration-test module
"installable" to see everything is working ok
and now I'm realizing the SPI is also installed although it is configured
to skip install.

Hope this is helpful somehow for the new "special cases"
thanks
tonio

I have a question in order to make our dev managers warm and fuzzy.

My understanding is that a pom that compiles under 2.1.0 and 3.0.5 produces=
 the same jars. I know this to be true so long as either version of Maven is=
 pulling down the correct versions of SDK's used to build the java files but=
 I need some kind of "official" stamp on that to ease nervousness.

Thanks!

Knowing that something can be done and should be easy is half the battle! I
have no idea why the people in charge of deployments had problems figuring
out how to do this - it only took me a few hours to get everything nailed
down.

The first project I was switching to mvn3 I was also skeptical about the
ear produced being the same.

You must ensure both mvn2 and mvn3 use the same version of java (check
using mvn -version)

Separately explode the ear created by each version of mvn (lets call them A
and B) and and all war files within each ear using winzip or 7zip or some
other tool.
Use windiff to compare the exploded folders getting it to show any files
only in A or or only B and anything not identical.

There should not be any files that are only in one set or the other. All
differences have to be investigated. Only items that contain
date/timestrings or timestamps should show up. These may appear in your
manifest.mf (time of build) . Some 3rd party tools put date/time objects
into files also (e.g. flex).  These would also show as differences. Any
jars with differences need to be exploded so you can see which file(s) are
different inside of them. Looking at the differences in class files is
doable also but not pretty.

Hi,
   The maven version I am using is Maven 3.0.4.  When I try to compile a 
Java project, the error that states is "enums are not supported in 
-source 1.3
(use -source 5 or higher to enable enums)".

   My java version is JDK 7.0 and the JAVA_HOME variable is set 
correctly and part of the build path.

   I understand that the java version has to be configured in the 
pom.xml for the project to make use of JDK 7.0.
The clarification I needed is if Maven version 3.0.4 then isn't by 
default uses JDK 5.0 and above?
I don't need to change the value for each and every pom.xml for the 
projects that I work.
Please let me know if you have any workaround.

Thanks,
Raghavendra Nandagopal

This is controlled by the maven-compiler-plugin. The version of that plugin
that Maven 3.0.4 uses by default uses Java 5 by default. So you must either
have an older version of the plugin defined or a configuration of that
plugin stating Java 1.3.
If you check the effective-pom it should be "easy" to tell.

Hi,
The templating-m-p as stated in the documentation was exactly designed to
filter source files. Its name might not make it that obvious but it's
because the idea is to some day support other templating engines.

In your case, you have to design your source files with variables inside
and the plugin will first filter source file then add it for compilation.

The plugin uses standard maven properties. So if that properties must come
from an external file that is another issue (properties:read-properties
approximate goal name is a way to go).

You would think so, but a co-worker of mine ran into the same issue =
without putting anything in his POM. He had installed it using apt-get =
on ubuntu, but when he replaced that with 3.0.4 from the maven website, =
it worked fine. I never delved into the issue, but I wonder if apt-get =
is somehow finding a different 3.0.4?

I was talking about official Maven core. Any tweaked version could be
differently.
However, the effective-pom would show what is used. I.e. an older version

problem we actually ended up removing a pile of dependencies included which
were no longer required shaving about 7mb from the binary so it ended up
being fruitful anyway..!

Well, as Maven delegates some important parts like compilation to plugins
or even external tools like javac, any risk of being different is quite low=
.

And put differently, as what you ask is actually controlled by the
maven-ear-plugin, maven-jar-plugin, etc. and not by maven core (granted you
locked plugin versions as one should do, sure), the risk is very low that
there's anything different (without upgrading one of those plugin which may
new behaviour and/or bug.

We migrated from m2 to m3 some time ago a quite big numbers of projects
(I'd say more 30+ if talking about multimodule build, and even tens or
hundreds if you speak of projects/modules), and we didn't encounter
importantly noticeable differences.

Subject: m2e workspace resolution doesn't include test-classes
From: Peter Kahn <citizenkahn@gmail.com>

Hi all,

Does anyone have a workaround for m2e no longer adding target/test-classes
to launcher when workspace resolution is used?  This used to work but
doesn't anymore which forces us to add folders and projects to launchers
manually.

After closing  dependent projects in workspace I see the test jars on my
classpath.  It is only when they are opened that resolution fails.  I saw a
discussion back in may on this  topic (
http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/m2e-dev/msg01343.html) and was hoping
someone had a workaround.

Thanks

Peter

Apologies is m2e is too off topic for this list.

Subject: Parent SNAPSHOT not resolved Maven 2.2.1 - 3.0.4 - (Nexus repo)
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
X-Virus-Checked: Checked by ClamAV on apache.org

A maven project which have a parent SNAPSHOT cannot be resolved when :

a) the Parent SNAPSHOT pom is not present in the local maven repository 
b) the Parent SNAPSHOT pom is deployed in a Nexus repository by another
developer.
c) settings.xml has a mirror redirecting all (*) to Nexus
d) there is no <repository> entry in the settings.xml file as Nexus is used
for all resolutions.

Easy to reproduce on Maven 2.2.1, 3.0.4 and probably earlier releases.

- If the SNAPSHOT parent is instead used as a dependency of the project then
maven can resolve the dependency and retrieve it from Nexus.

Work around:

If you add a dumb repo entry in the settings.xml file, then it works.

Exemple of such entry is a fake repository and it does not even have to be a
snapshot repo...

settings.xml

[...]
<repositories>
        <repository>
                <id>foo</id>
                <url>http://foo</url>
        </repository>
</repositories> 
[...]

simplest work around.

But to MHO, there is a bug in the Maven code when doing parent snapshot
resolution. If the parent snapshot is not present in the local repo AND
there is no <repository> entry in the settings.xml file, it simply fails. It
does not try the mirror.

As I believe this was discussed on the Nexus list, the reason is what you
state. You have no repo defined in settings.xml, which means that only the
default central repo declaration is used which is only configured for
releases and not snapshots. And you're trying to retreieve a snapshot.
So this wouldn't be a bug in core.

You wrote it so nicely:

repo != mirror.

So, you have no repo set (only Central, that cannot contain snapshots), so
there is no "candidate" repo at all present to even try to get a snapshot
from.

Mirror on the other hand is NOT a repo, it merely _redirects_ existing
reposes to some other URL.

I understand your point, but the explaination you provide is based on how it
is implemented...and not on how it is specified.

The fact that maven can resolve the same artifact when it is a dependency
means that it is not a limitation but an implementation issue.

That looks bad to me to have to add a fake repository to have Maven resolve
the parent SNAPSHOT.

Note that in my example the foo repository does not exist at all neither
http://foo URL. 
It is juste a fake declaration in the settings.xml.

This means that maven at the end, failover and still uses the mirror to go
to Nexus and retrieve the SNAPSHOT parent.

Why (repo!=mirror) applies to Parent and not to project dependencies ?

At the end we added the fake repo declaration to all our settings.xml, but
that's not very elegant, but it works.

It should be the same for deps as well as parents. One difference could be
if you have a repo declared in the pom (not setiings.xml). It might be that
that repo is only used for deps and not the parent, I don't know.

FWIW, I've run some tests locally and confirm it is the same for =
(non-reactor) dependencies when you don't have a snapshot repository =
declared in your pom hierarchy or settings.xml

Use "mvn help:effective-pom" to check as a lot of corporate/oss =

otherwise Maven would not know where to fetch non-reactor snapshots.

PS. note that an anaemic repository entry with just an id and url is =
still considered a snapshot repository because the default setting for =
the snapshots and releases flags is true unless configured otherwise.

Ok, lets talk with a concrete simple example:

PARENT POM:

<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0

	</distributionManagement>
</project>
---------------------------------------------------
CHILD POM

<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0
http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">
  <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>

  <parent>
    <groupId>a.b.c</groupId>
    <artifactId>parente</artifactId>

  <groupId>a.c</groupId>
  <artifactId>deleteme</artifactId>
  <version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
  <name>aaa</name>
  <description>bbb</description>
</project>
-----------------------------------------------------

These very simple Poms demonstrate the problem.

You need to deply parent first and then delete parent from local repo and
then try building child.
As you notice there are no SNAPSHOT repository declaration nowhere.
Distibution managment is a separate thing in the parent itself.

The scenario described below fails for me with or without a mirror =
setting - as I would expect it to.

Given a child project with a missing parent pom Maven will attempt to =
resolve the parent given the available context, namely:

	settings.xml
	current pom.xml
	Maven's super-pom

If neither the settings.xml nor the current pom.xml define a snapshot =
repository then the only repository definition is from Maven's default =
super-pom:

  <repositories>
    <repository>
      <snapshots>
        <enabled>false</enabled>
      </snapshots>
      <id>central</id>
      <name>Central Repository</name>
      <url>http://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2</url>
    </repository>
  </repositories>

which clearly disables snapshots.

Defining a mirror in your settings.xml does not change repository =
definitions, as Tamas mentioned before all it does is re-route requests =
via the mirror. Therefore since there are no repositories defined with =
snapshots enabled, Maven will not request to fetch the parent pom =
snapshot. But if you add a snapshot repository definition somewhere =
(settings.xml or current pom.xml) then Maven will respect that and =
request the parent pom snapshot from that repository. If you have a =
mirror in your settings.xml then that request will be routed via the =
server defined in the mirror.

Note that Maven will also attempt to use the parent relativePath =
definition from the current pom to attempt to find the parent pom on =
disk - so assuming the default relativePath, Maven would also be able to =
find the parent pom if it was located in the parent directory relative =
to the child (../pom.xml).

The same thing is true of snapshot dependencies - if none of your =
settings.xml, pom.xml, or any pom in the hierarchy define a snapshot =
repository then Maven will not have anywhere it could request the =
snapshot from, regardless of the mirror definition (as mirror !=3D =
repository). Only if the snapshot dependency was available somewhere in =
the reactor (the effective plan of the build on disk) would Maven be =
able to resolve the snapshot.

Thanks for the clear explanation.

All our artifacts are served by our Nexus Repository Manager (external and
internal).
All our repositories (hosted and proxy) are managed by Nexus, this is why
our settings.xml and parent poms does not need to refer to other
repositories because we want to control all from Nexus.

So declaring a fake snapshot repository will help Maven re-route resolution
to a parent pom...

BTW if you replace the snapshot parent by a release version, the same
problem appear despite the maven central in super pom...

Again adding the fake repository helps solving the case.

I am still not convinced it is a feature ;-)

This isn't what I see locally using the same poms as below, with the =
parent version set to a release it will attempt to fetch it:

	...snip...
	Downloading: =
http://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/a/b/c/parente/0.0.1/parente-0.0.1.pom

Repeating the same test using a mirror (and clearing the local =
repository of any cached records about the pom, see below):

	...snip...
	Downloading: =
https://some.repo.manager/content/groups/some.group/a/b/c/parente/0.0.1/pa=
rente-0.0.1.pom

Note that Maven will record failed attempts to fetch releases in your =
local repository:

	[ERROR] Non-resolvable parent POM: Failure to find =
a.b.c:parente:pom:0.0.1 in http://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2 was =
cached in the local repository,
		resolution will not be reattempted until the update =
interval of central has elapsed or updates are forced and =
'parent.relativePath' points at wrong local POM @ line 7, column 10 -> =
[Help 2]

and will not attempt to fetch the release again until the update =
interval elapses (default is daily) or you use -U to force it to =
re-check.

>=20
> I am still not convinced it is a feature ;-)

Since there is no snapshot repository defined in the current pom.xml, =
settings.xml, or Maven super-pom - and the relativePath doesn't lead to =
the parent pom - how should Maven know where to fetch it?

I guess you could say that defining a mirror in your settings.xml should =
add an implicit snapshot repository definition, but how would you remove =
such a repository definition if you didn't want it? Because each =
snapshot repository is queried separately, if you then defined =
additional snapshot repositories then you could end up with multiple =
queries going through the mirror. In a way this all comes back to the =
fact that mirror !=3D repository and I'm not sure that mixing these =
concepts by adding implicit repositories based on mirror definitions is =
a good thing - especially when there's a simple solution (declare the =
repository in settings.xml) that captures the intent and would also work =
when not mirroring.

(just my 2 sen)

Hi,

We have some unit tests that were always forked per-test in ant, and are =
now converting to maven. The forkmode =3D always setting works, but =
without it, a number of the tests fail (there are issues with the way =
they are written, and we don't have time to rewrite them right now). The =
forkmode parameter is deprecated, but it is not clear to us how to get =
the same behavior with the forkCount and reuseFork settings. What is the =
recommended way to handle this?

Thanks,
Russ

This is an error that I get when I execute my project in Eclipse/STS 
while running from a RAM drive.
If I run the same project running on Eclipse/STS while running on a 
regular disk drive it works.

It is pretty deep in the Maven code and looks like Maven/Plexus sends a 
bad argument to a Java function.

I have found another complaint like this by Googling but no one had any 
suggestion about how to fix it.

My only fix is to stop using my high speed version and build it in my 
slow disk based Eclipse and maven (Same software just not on a RAM drive).

I am intrigued by the idea that I am able to achieve some ability to 
reverse time but it does not actually let me get more work done in a 
day. Quite the contrary.

Some related reports from 2011:

	https://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MJAR-142
	https://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MWAR-255

AFAICT the PlexusIoFileResource is effectively doing =
setLastModified(file.lastModified()) to=20

	=
https://github.com/sonatype/plexus-io/blob/master/src/main/java/org/codeha=
us/plexus/components/io/resources/PlexusIoFileResource.java#L107

This JDK bug could be triggering the problem:

	http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=3D6791812

In which case the PlexusIoFileResource code just needs to be more =
defensive and not trust that lastModified returns a positive value...

Hi all,

we have a rather complex project structure with a lot of projects and a
couple of code generators that produce java classes for production and
test. The challenge now is to configure the build files so that a mvn
eclipse:eclipse run will create all required source folders and set the
correct output folders, for example:

src folder: src/main/code-gen
out folder: (default) -> target/classes

src folder: src/test/code-gen
out folder: target/test-classes

Currently we use the maven build helper to set the source folders but I
still don't know how to set the out dirs - now it creates a project config
that compiles production and test classes into the same out folder which
actually causes conflicts.

Is there any way to "fine-tune" the .classpath file programmatically?

Cheers,

Andreas

Hi All,

I'm working in environment for which we would like to centralize the build
configuration.
We are using already project parent to control centrally several versions
of the plugins.

Now we would like to extend it about controlling invoking of the plugins in
order to
minimize the amount of configuration that gets duplicated in each of the
child projects.

We found two options and considering the option 1 as this one which will
fit our need.
The motivation for invoke removal in parent context is to use this parent
for mentioned
plug-in itself.

Q1: Is there any pitfall related to fact that parent will contain reference
to the
plug-in which will use this parent ?

Q2: Is there any other options to exclude plug-in invoke from parent only ?

Best regards, Tomasz.

Thanks Russell Gold, It worked.

I had installed in ubuntu through apt-get but then replaced it from the
maven website download.  It is working fine now.  It is to do with some
sort of installation that ubuntu does to maven version.

Thanks,
Raghavendra Nandagopal

Are you aware of m2e and other options for using Maven in Eclipse? I'm
just not convinced you will get what you want from m-e-p in any
reasonable timeframe without adjusting the code yourself and donating
changes back.

Under build I have:

                </executions>
            </plugin>

The execution "verify" is the bit I've just added but my build blows up:

Caused by: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Class

( etc )

I'm guessing that I've added the instruction the the pom incorrectly but
the documentation lacks an in-context example. Can anyone shed light on
this?

Thanks,
James

Just a guess:
You didn't specify a phase for the executions with id "prepare" and 
"verify"...?

According to the documentation they both/all bind to default phases and I'm
in no position to disagree.

What happens if you run:

mvn test-compile eclipse:eclipse=20

instead of just

mvn eclipse:eclipse


By default, eclipse:eclipse just runs far enough to get the source =
directories, not all the test directories.   If you force maven to run =
to the test-compile phase, then it should be able to pick everything up.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

I'm using maven-compiler-plugin to show Xlint warnings on `mvn compile`. I
would like to hide the INFO output before and after these warnings, so I
tried `mvn clean && mvn compile -q`. However, this also hides the Xlint
warnings.

How can I tweak my pom so that `mvn compile` or `mvn compile -q` hides INFO
messages, but shows WARNING messages? Is there another log level above
quiet that shows more messages, but not INFO messages?

Hi all

Stackoverflow provided the
answer...<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19147684/work-around-for-m2e-workspace-resolution-lacking-test-classes-in-launcher-classp/19186830?noredirect=1#19186830>
Maven favors test-jar type over test classifier and m2e follows suite.
type does that right thing adding the test jar to the classpath on launcher
classpath resolution.  Classifier doesn't add the test jar to classpath.



Thanks

Peter

Hi,

I think you are confusing two things: Build goals and Report goals.
Any goal (both build and report goals) that's executed directly from  
commandline should be configured as part of the build plugin.
If you want a plugin to generate reports as part of the *site* lifecycle,  
then you need to configure it in reporting section.

So I think the documentation is correct.

Robert

I'm seeing weird behavior when running maven assembly on Jenkins.

My assembly descriptor, stripped down, is

<dependencySet>
   <includes>
      <include>${project.groupId}:*:jar</include>
      <include>${project.groupId}:*:va</include>
   </include>
   <outputFileNameMapping>${artifact.artifactId}.${artifact.extension}</out=
putFileNameMapping>
</dependencySet>

<dependencySet>
   <outputDirectory>lib</outputDirectory>
   <includes/>
   <excludes>
      <exclude>${project.groupId}:*</exclude>
   </excludes>
</dependencySet>

(The 'va' classifier is used for custom skinny wars. They'll built and inst=
alled earlier.)

The results on my desktop are what you would expect.

On Jenkins it looks like everything is run through the first stanza - all i=
n the parent directory, all have versions stripped. Worse I'm also seeing t=
he standard .war file in addition to the 'va' .war files. In short it's act=
ing like <includes/> instead of one that specifies only a handful of depend=
encies.
Both systems are running Maven 2.2.1 and other builds are successful. It's =
just this plugin that's acting squirrelly. Any ideas?

Thanks,

Bear

Why isn't there a way to set the ownership of files packaged by the 
assembly plugin, similar to how it allows you to set permissions?
The unix tar program offers --user= and --group=.  Is there any way
to do this in the assembly plugin?

still a host of reasons to avoid this scheme.

What are you trying to do? The 'why' may also help.

You can also try qulice-maven-plugin that does all pre-configuration for
you (Checkstyle, PMD, FindBugs, etc.):

Hi all,

I've released the first experimental version of jcabi-mysql-maven-plugin,
which starts MySQL server at pre-integration-test phase and shuts it down
on post-integration-test phase. With this plugin you can write integration
tests against an on-demand MySQL server, avoiding the necessity to mock it
with in-memory databases or relying on a always-running testing server.

The plugin is in github, please feel free to submit ideas/bugs:
https://github.com/jcabi/jcabi-mysql-maven-plugin

Tonio,

I've created and fixed https://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MINSTALL-99
I've deployed a 2.5.1-SNAPSHOT to  
https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/snapshots/ ready for  
test, would be nice if you could test this.

thanks,

Robert

Thanks! qulice-maven-plugin is very cool! Though I don't necessarily want
my builds for different projects to fail on lint warnings.

I'm working in a very specialized legacy environment in which it would 
be nice to have an archive (.tar.gz) that had all the permissions as I 
want from the start.  Granted it's not all that hard to do after 
unpackaging with chmod running under find, but it would be nice if the 
base-directory itself had a <directory-mode> as do the <filesets> that 
get packaged under it.  Bottom-line: the plugin doesn't give me the same 
level of control as the OS does.

Martin, yes, I'm well aware of that functionality.
However, I cannot figure out how to apply it to the base directory.

Let's say I've set all my filesets which are packaged underneath the 
base directory to
<directoryMode>775</directoryMode>
<fileMode>664</fileMode>

The plugin handles this beautifully.

But let's suppose I want the basedir of the archive to also be
<directoryMode>775</directoryMode>

That does not seem possible.  At least I have not figured out how to do it.

Steve

It does not.  I hadn't tried using '/' as the output directory spec 
(i.e. the base-directory) but it doesn't help.  The basic problem is this:

The archiver does not create an entry in the archive for the 
base-directory.  This is because no matter where you put the 
<directoryMode> it applies to directories WITHIN that <fileset>, not to
the root of the fileset itself.  If a directory entry is not created
in the archive, then the -p switch of tar will have nothing to 
"preserve" and just use the default permission for the directory.

Really, I think to make this work, one would have to be somehow be able 
to put a <directoryMode> on <base-directory> itself.  But this would be 
a change to the plugin.

I have found the following.

Given an assembly descriptor that produces an .tar.gz archive,
if more than one fileset provides content feeding into the same output 
directory, the archiver does not create a folder entry in the archive.
This means that there is nothing to apply a <directoryMode> to, and when 
the archive is expanded, the default instead of the desired permissions 
are used in that output directory.

In other words, given the following:

   <fileSet>
     <directory>src/A</directory>
     <outputDirectory>dest</outputDirectory>
     <includes>
       <include>**</include>
     </includes>
     <fileMode>664</fileMode>
     <directoryMode>775</fileMode>
   </fileSet>
   <fileSet>
     <directory>src/B</directory>
     <outputDirectory>dest</outputDirectory>
     <includes>
       <include>**</include>
     </includes>
     <fileMode>664</fileMode>
     <directoryMode>775</fileMode>
   </fileSet>

an archive will be produced without a directory entry for dest.  When 
the archive is expanded the permissions of the dest directory will be 
the default, not 775.

hi,

i am using maven compiler plugin. i havent mentioned anything related to
plugin in POM.xml

i have just used the command on command prompt
mvn compiler:compile
what is happening is , above command compiles the test classes also .
however which should not be the case

in my opinion, only main java source files should get compiled and when i
execute compiler:testcompile goal , then only test classes should get
compile

please suggest how to just compile main source files and skip test cases
compilation

regards

Hi Irfan,

The behavior you describe sounds surprising. Can you attach a full =
listing of the run when you do mvn compile:compile?

Thanks,
Russ

What would that mean? Do you want to execute the program in the debugger?

Yes. I'm looking for a task like `mvn jdb:debug <Class>` that starts a jdb
session on <Class>.main().

I can run jdb on individual Java code outside of a Maven structure, but I'm
not sure how to inform jdb of Java code in a Maven project, Maven's
CLASSPATH handling, etc. etc.

The simplest way to do this is actually to run it in your IDE directly. =
IntellijIDEA community edition can import your maven project and thus =
get all of the dependencies. Then you just run the program in the =
debugger. I presume Eclipse can do something similar.

Hi Andrew,

Another option is to use the exec-maven-plugin to launch your java program
of choice, then attach to it with jdb afterward using the "-attach" option.

I could also use an IDE for package management, but I'd rather use plain

I could also use an IDE for package management, but I'd rather use plain Ma=

Yes, various Java IDEs can debug Java code, including Java code organized
in Maven projects. What I'm interested in is debugging Java code in a Maven
project with an arbitrary text editor, not necessarily Eclipse or Intellij,
for example Emacs, or even Notepad, by invoking Maven tasks that point to
Maven plugins that interact with jdb.

That is very interesting.=20
It may be hard, because the line numbers in java byte code needs to associa=
ted with the lines numbers in the source file.
However, It may be possible to do that in emacs and vim.

Yes, various Java IDEs can debug Java code, including Java code organized i=
n Maven projects. What I'm interested in is debugging Java code in a Maven =
project with an arbitrary text editor, not necessarily Eclipse or Intellij,=
 for example Emacs, or even Notepad, by invoking Maven tasks that point to =
Maven plugins that interact with jdb.

I've finally been able to track down the problem. My pom.xml file didn't sp=
ecify a version for maven-assembly-plugin. On my system it worked. On the b=
uild server and a coworker's system it failed despite everyone running the =
same version of maven.

Once I explicitly specified a version it started working everywhere.

Subject: maven assembly: different behavior on Jenkins

I'm seeing weird behavior when running maven assembly on Jenkins.

My assembly descriptor, stripped down, is

<dependencySet>
   <includes>
      <include>${project.groupId}:*:jar</include>
      <include>${project.groupId}:*:va</include>
   </include>
   <outputFileNameMapping>${artifact.artifactId}.${artifact.extension}</out=
putFileNameMapping>
</dependencySet>

<dependencySet>
   <outputDirectory>lib</outputDirectory>
   <includes/>
   <excludes>
      <exclude>${project.groupId}:*</exclude>
   </excludes>
</dependencySet>

(The 'va' classifier is used for custom skinny wars. They'll built and inst=
alled earlier.)

The results on my desktop are what you would expect.

On Jenkins it looks like everything is run through the first stanza - all i=
n the parent directory, all have versions stripped. Worse I'm also seeing t=
he standard .war file in addition to the 'va' .war files. In short it's act=
ing like <includes/> instead of one that specifies only a handful of depend=
encies.
Both systems are running Maven 2.2.1 and other builds are successful. It's =
just this plugin that's acting squirrelly. Any ideas?

Thanks,

Bear

Well, the problem is spelled out in the error text. The archetype can't be
found.
The docs isn't very clear on this, but I expect that the value for the
archetypeRepository
parameter isn't right. Maybe it should be a URL; I wouldn't know without
looking in the code.

Is this an archetype found in central? If not you should talk to the people
maintaining the archetype. Also, if you're in a corporate network the
problem could be any of the limitations of the archetype plugin not
honoring mirrors and proxies configured in settings.xml (see JIRA tickets).

+1.
And BTW you should be aware that calling a dedicated goal should actually
be a rare use case using Maven. Maybe even more calling the compiler
outside the standard lifecycle.
Just type mvn compile for your first case and mvn test-compile for the
second one (not that last one would also compile SRC/main sources btw).

We still want more people to get up and join the committer community.

It has been a year since Stephen posted on his blog -
http://javaadventure.blogspot.ie/2012/07/do-you-want-to-become-maven-committer.html

So I thought a yearly reminder for would be a good thing.

Yes, very interesting - but where is the Maven source found? The site is =
a bit confusing on that score, and it is rather difficult to construct a =
patch when you cannot see the CM system.

Which bit are you interested in?
If its a plugin on http://maven.apache.org/plugins/index.html then
click on it and on the left under Project Documentation > Project
Information > Source Repository you will find it.

The Issue Tracking link will take you to Jira where you can find the
existing defects. If your problem is not already there, then create
one.

Why would anyone want to do this? So we don't have to debug Maven projects
with Eclipse/IntelliJ, but the text editor of our choice. This is best
accomplished by Maven tasks which interact with the command line jdb tool.

Why would you want to walk from New York to San Francisco when you can fly?

Some people are gluttons for punishment, some people like text-mode (works
better over plain ssh without resorting to eg X11 forwarding)

Finally debugging when the debugger and debugged process are on the same
machine rather than separated by a 150ms latency link is a lot nicer... And
sadly cli tools are the only way to handle that without adding significant
lag.

Having said all that, debuggers are the tool of last resort, if you need to
use them you start worrying about heisenbugs etc.

A good log file beats the pants off a debugger 99 times out of 100... Ask
anyone who tried to figure out why the conference call talker indicators
were invalid or did work on any real time system and they will swear by a

Me... I worked on real time conferencing systems, so a good log file is
what I favour, you can't single step debug a real time teleconference ;-)
the skills you learn trying figure out techniques to debug such systems are
very valuable

This is useful for many reasons.  The less steps required to use external
dependencies the better.  If someone must add and configure xml to add a
dependency, it leads to human in the loop, which leads to errors.

I am all about how quick, I can get installed.

For instance, maybe I am writing an organizations how to, to download the
standard speech jar.

I would rather say, issue these ten commands:

curl http://dl.ghost4j.org/ghost4j-0.5.0.zip > ghost4j-0.5.0.zip

open ghost4j-0.5.0.zip

/usr/bin/mvn install:install-file -Dfile=ghost4j-0.5.0/ghost4j-0.5.0.jar
-Dpackaging=jar -DgroupId=org.ghost4j -DartifactId=ghost4j -Dversion=0.5.0
-DaddToPom=true

-Dpackaging=jar -DgroupId=org.ghost4j -DartifactId=jna -Dversion=3.3.0

More commands, fine, but command line also leads to automation.  Users can
include ghostscript via a batch file!

A lot of developers are asking for simplicity of java development.
Especially folks who code in other languages such as python, view java as h=
eavy weight because of IDEs.
It takes a while to master IDEs, without IDEs java is not a productive envi=
ronment.

I used to do Java development using CLI, but after I got used to IDEs devel=
opment was a lot easier.
IDEs do bring a lot of value .
So, why not bring the nice features of IDEs into editors such as emacs or v=
im.

Debugging is one of the important features that is easy to do in IDE, but h=
ard to do in CLI using jdb.
If there is a way (plugin) that can enable this for emacs or vim, would be =
a great.

Why would you want to walk from New York to San Francisco when you can fly?

Some people are gluttons for punishment, some people like text-mode (works =
better over plain ssh without resorting to eg X11 forwarding)

Finally debugging when the debugger and debugged process are on the same ma=
chine rather than separated by a 150ms latency link is a lot nicer... And s=
adly cli tools are the only way to handle that without adding significant l=
ag.

Having said all that, debuggers are the tool of last resort, if you need to=
 use them you start worrying about heisenbugs etc.

A good log file beats the pants off a debugger 99 times out of 100... Ask a=
nyone who tried to figure out why the conference call talker indicators wer=
e invalid or did work on any real time system and they will swear by a good=
 log file with mapped diagnostic context support.

Me... I worked on real time conferencing systems, so a good log file is wha=
t I favour, you can't single step debug a real time teleconference ;-) the =
skills you learn trying figure out techniques to debug such systems are ver=
y valuable

Hi all,

Rather than getting into an eclipse vs. vim vs. emacs flamewar, I'd rather
just ask: Andrew, did you try attaching your jdb to a running java instance
launched via exec-maven-plugin as I suggested yet?

You can configure exec-maven-plugin in your pom so that launching the
compatible java process is as easy as "mvn exec:exec". You could even
specify jdb as the executable directly if that's what you want and then you
wouldn't even need the attachment step. Using profiles (yes, this is one of
their benign uses!) you can even set up multiple different behaviors of
exec:exec for different common situations. Really I don't think there is
any need whatsoever for a dedicated "mvn exec:jdb" here.

For Eclipse (my preferred tool): http://eclim.org/

I know people who use it to good effect, but personally I don't use it. I
prefer the opposite approach: embedding vim editing style into Eclipse:
http://vrapper.sourceforge.net/home/

Vim and Eclipse both bring so much productivity I would hate to give up
either of them. Fortunately, you don't have to. :-)

Regards,
Curtis

Here is another use case.  Suppose I programmatically want to make sure that
my database is backwards compatible with all versions of my application.  I
may have a test suite that compiles the project using different jars, which
represent different versions of the persistence module.

I can verify no exceptions or errors and that data can be extracted.  I
could alos programmatically determine that a database created with any
version was readable by any other version.  This is huge!

Imagine the database is expanding, fields being added and deleted.  If the
database was created and writen using my-database-1.0.3-jar, could it be
read with 1.0.2-jar and 1.0.5-jar.  You may not be able to do anything about
1.0.2 reading 1.0.3, because 1.0.3 is already released, but that would
enable you to create a database jar that was forward compatible (or
scalable) and backwards compatible.

Thank you, Curtis, that looks like an excellent suggestion!

Could you elaborate on the exact <plugin>...</plugin> snippet I would need
to drop into my pom.xml in order to achieve this?

If I could just `mvn exec:exec <Class>`, starting a jdb session on
<Class>.main(), that would be *perfect*.

Hi Andrew,

<plugin>
  <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
  <artifactId>exec-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>1.2.1</version>
  <configuration>
    <executable>jdb</executable>
    <arguments>
      <argument>-classpath</argument>
      <classpath />
      <argument>${jdb.mainClass}</argument>
    </arguments>
  </configuration>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <goals>
        <goal>exec</goal>
      </goals>
    </execution>
  </executions>
</plugin>

We can get close. If you use the block above, you would launch with:

    mvn -Djdb.mainClass=<Class> exec:exec

Where "jdb.mainClass" is the property used in the XML above. And if that is
not concise enough for your taste you can choose a property with a shorter
name.

Working example inside a profile with a specific main class is here:

https://github.com/imagej/imagej/commit/8cfe0fde7d89c71e083c992f5c7432b29f09c483

Regards,
Curtis

You could run it via the maven-exec-plugin, which allows you to pass down the classpath.

Subject: Tomcat Servlet wen converted to maven fails to find servlet-api

Hi all,
I have created a dynamic web app with a servlet and jsp. The application
works fine and I had downloaded and included the jars manually in the
project. I want to integrate with Maven so i converted it into Maven project
using eclipse. I have the pom include the dependency for servlet-api.jar but
when I clean install I get the following error:

Subject: Re: Is there any maven plugin to add dependency to existing pom.xml ?

I use the maven invoker plugin for this, by parameterizing a pom so
that I can substitute various versions. By using the 'pom dependency'
thing, you could perhaps do this for entire dependencies as opposed to
versions. Or you could script pom editing; there are XML-editing Maven
plugin and ant plugins out there.

There is only one pre-requisite... Namely that you have enough interest to
motivate yourself.

We don't have a "magic bullet"... It's more a way of saying "hey I'd like
to be a committer, can I have some people to mentor me as I try to show I
have what it takes"

We don't set homework, good committers find their own homework ;-)

We don't set deadlines, this is a volunteer project.

And you don't have to join to become a committer, this is just a way we
thought of to try and help people who want to become a committer achieve
their goal

I'm trying to set up my first modular project, and it's not working.
The child project cannot find its dependencies.  Actually, it doesn't
even try to find them.  It just tries to compile my source, which
fails because the dependencies aren't in the classpath.

Here's my parent pom: https://github.com/kjkrum/DarkMatter/blob/master/pom.xml
And here's the module:
https://github.com/kjkrum/DarkMatter/blob/master/weapon/pom.xml

The dependencies are present in my repo: http://chalcodes.com/maven
Other (non-modular) projects using the same repo build just fine.

What am I doing wrong?

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

I think I've solved my earlier question about my poms.  Now I need to
deploy a third-party jar to my remote repo.  I tried this command:

$ mvn deploy:deploy-file -DgroupId=de.kuxfamily -DartifactId=glasslib
-Dversion=1.0 -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=glasslib.jar
-DrepositoryId=chalcodes -Durl=scpexe://chalcodes.com/maven

It says there is no connector available.  I installed some jars in my
~/.m2/lib: wagon-ssh-2.5.jar, wagon-ssh-common-2.5.jar, and
wagon-ssh-external-2.5.jar.  I also tried changing the protocol to
scp.  No dice.

Should I write a pom to deploy this artifact?  Can I deploy it as part
of an existing project, and have it be available at compile time?

What dependencies can not be found?
What is the error message?
I am not sure what classpath has to do with this; do you mean build path?
What IDE are you using? Does it show any errors?

The problem turned out to be that the POMs included with the library I
forked didn't actually run the compiler plugin.  The jars were just
full of resources!  So of course the packages didn't exist.  I fixed
the POMs and everything was groovy.

Hi Kevin,

first of all, there is no ~/.m2/lib, Maven solely relies on plugins and 
its dependencies. This isn't Ant.

As far as I can remember, Maven 3 has one two default Wagon providers: 
File and HTTP. You need to declare additional dependencies [1]. 
Unfortunately, I do not know how to declare this dependency when you 
solely perform a deploy:deploy-file.

Anyway, is there a reason why you don't use a repo manager like Nexus?

Michael

Hi Kevin,

Yes, you will need a POM unless your server understands the http PUT =
command. When you issue the mvn command, maven will look in your current =
directory for a POM even though it won't be using any of its standard =
life cycles. Those will define any plugins, connectors, and so on.

Assuming your server understands scp, you might put in your pom =
something like:

<build>
    <extensions>
        <extension>
            <groupId>org.apache.maven.wagon</groupId>
            <artifactId>wagon-ssh</artifactId>
            <version>1.0</version>
        </extension>
    </extensions>
</build>

Of course, you would still need a way to specify your credentials, =
preferably in your ~/.m2/settings.xml

There is a free version of the Nexus repository manager. That will be =
much easier to use than this.

Regards,
Russ

Weird.  I found a bunch of how-tos that said that was how to do it.
Maybe in an older version?

Yeah... my $8/month host doesn't support it.  I'm just hosting my
personal projects.

No they said you can put the deps in $MAVEN_HOME/lib

But better is to use a real repository manager

Duh!  Thank you.  That led me to the solution.  I placed the ssh wagon
jars in /usr/share/maven/libs, and it almost worked.  Then I just had
to change the url parameter from the public alias to the actual
hostname and non-standard port my host requires me to use for ssh.

$ mvn deploy:deploy-file -DgroupId=de.kuxfamily -DartifactId=glasslib
-Dversion=1.0 -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=glasslib.jar
-DrepositoryId=chalcodes
-Durl=scpexe://$SSH_HOST:$SSH_PORT/$HOME/public_html/maven


> But better is to use a real repository manager

Eh... overkill for my purposes.

Thanks again.

So close! I added the snippet inside my
<build><plugins>...</plugins></build> in pom.xml. Thanks for supplying the
exact code, by the way!

But jdb is showing an error:

$ mvn exec:exec -Djdb.mainClass=HelloMaven
Initializing jdb ...

run HelloMaven
Set uncaught java.lang.Throwable

VM Started:

main[1]

This happens for any class I hand exec:exec.

This is the same error I see if I try to jdb <Class> manually.

Are we sure the <argument>-classpath</argument><classpath /> bit is the
correct way to hand jdb the CLASSPATH?

Hi Andrew,

> (uncaught)"thread=main", java.net.URLClassLoader$1.run(), line=202 bci=73

Not sure what to tell you. I tested it with my project and was able to
launch my app from jdb as usual; see:
https://github.com/imagej/imagej/commit/8cfe0fde7d89c71e083c992f5c7432b29f09c483

> Are we sure the <argument>-classpath</argument><classpath /> bit is
> the correct way to hand jdb the CLASSPATH?

Yep, at least on my OS X system with Sun Java 1.7.0_21:

$ jdb -version
This is jdb version 1.6 (Java SE version 1.7.0_21)

$ jdb -help | grep classpath
    -classpath <directories separated by ":">

Is your "HelloMaven" class really in the default package? What happens if
you change "jdb" to "java" in your exec; can you launch your application in
non-debug mode that way? If not, there is something fishy with either your
java main class or your classpath.

Regards,
Curtis

Ah, forgot to add the full namespace to the main class. This works:

$ cat pom.xml

Hi Ian,

Sorry for the delay in reply.

> release cycles, semantically versioned and depending on one another in
> a tree.

My group has a very similar situation -- multiple different source trees,
actually. I don't know of any tooling to do what you ask. But we built some
simple tooling to assist us in making rapid releases.

A shell script which uses the maven-release-plugin but with some features
specific to our projects:
https://github.com/scijava/scijava-common/blob/master/bin/release-version.sh

Instructions on using it:
https://github.com/imagej/imagej/blob/master/RELEASES.md

We are firm believers in "release early, release often" (or as Jeff Atwood
of StackOverflow fame puts it: "Go that way, really fast" [1]). So it is
vital that the release process be as simple as possible, so we can do
chained releases "up the tree" as needed very quickly.

I suppose the bigger your project tree gets, the more your hypothetical
"release everything that needs to be released" tooling could become a
life-saver. But it's also a very high-level operation with really big
potential ramifications if misused, then, too.

Regards,
Curtis

Subject: Multiple versions of same local jar
MIME-Version: 1.0

X-Virus-Checked: Checked by ClamAV on apache.org

Hi,

I'm using Maven for a Web project within Eclipse.

The project uses some libraries from the Maven repository, and 3 of my
libraries, which I've added to my local repository with the mvn
deploy:deploy-file command.

Whenever I package my .war file in Eclipse, I end up with an archive that
contains multiple versions of 2 of my personal libraries, even though my
dependencies only mention the latest library for each one.

In other words, I have a .war with the following structure :

Project.war
  - ...
  - WEB-INF
    - lib
      - ...
      - PersonalLib1-1.0.jar
      - PersonalLib1-1.1.jar
      - PersonalLib1-1.2.jar
      - ...
      - PersonalLib2-1.0.jar
      - PersonalLib2-1.1.jar
      - PersonalLib2-1.2.jar
      - PersonalLib2-1.3.jar
      - PersonalLib2-1.4.jar
      - ...

Any ideas ?

Idea 1:
You started of with one version and build your war multiple times while
updating the version. Maven does not automatically clean the WEB-INF/lib
folder in your target folder. Try a "mvn clean install" instead of just a
"mvn install".

Idea 2:
You have multiple versions of your lib in your dependency tree, but with
different groupId's. Maven will think those are different jar files. Check
your dependency tree with "mvn dependency:tree" to see where those
dependencies come from.

Subject: Maven profiles question
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
X-Virus-Checked: Checked by ClamAV on apache.org

I really do not understand any of the documentation related to the
<execution> plugin.

If I do something like:
  $mvn -P deploy

I need to:
 1. build the project (meaning I just want target/myproj.jar to exist
 2. Run a java program like:   $java -jar target/myproj.jar <some_options>

so I want to create a profile that will do both.  I realize that simply $mvn
install will build the target/myproj.jar but how would I add that to a maven
profile so that it does both the mvn install and runs $java -jar
target/myproj.jar <opts>

?

Any help would be appreciated, all of the documentation and examples I have
tried are not leading me to a solution.

Do you mean that you always want to run this program whenever you build =
it? Or you only want to run it when you activate the profile? Unless you =
do something unusual, "install" will always cause the jar to be created =
and installed in your local repository.

You might try adding to your pom something like:

<profiles>
    <profile>
        <id>run</id>
        <build>
            <plugins>
                <plugin>
                    <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
                    <artifactId>exec-maven-plugin</artifactId>
                    <version>1.2.1</version>
                    <executions>
                        <execution>
                            <phase>install</phase>
                            <goals>
                                <goal>java</goal>
                            </goals>
                            <configuration>
                                <mainClass>MyProgramName</mainClass>
                            </configuration>
                        </execution>
                    </executions>
                </plugin>
            </plugins>
        </build>
    </profile>
</profiles>

You can then build and run the program with:

	mvn install -Prun


BTW, (ahem) my video course on maven, linked below, has received some =
good reviews, if you're looking for more information. And I do cover =
profiles and the execution element.

Hi,
Thank you for sharing. I like some of the things you do in the script, like
squashing the commits.
Since no one responded I ALS wrote some tooling that takes the output of
dependency:tree from multiple projects, merges it, and given a target
artefact writes a bash script for all SNAPSHOT dependencies using mvn. To
release, the script is run. I will ask if it can be shared, at the moment I
can't share the code, it's closed source. Perhaps the description will help
someone.
Ian

No, don't use profiles. They are evil and shouldn't be used!

Please remember that Maven is a build tool. Don't try to do too much.
If the Java program is to be run during build, then you should bind that
plugin to the build lifecycle. You would then just have to execute "mvn
install" for example. Very simple and very much a build task.
If it is something outside of the build, then what you want to do
essentially is to first execute a Maven build and then use Maven as a
"utility tool" (i.e. execute one specific plugin goal). Don't use profiles
for this as it will stuff too much into the pom and confuse people. What
you should do is just accept a slightly longer execution command (e.g. "mvn
install exec:java") or put this "long" command into a shell script (or bat
file) and execute that script.
The exec:java you will configure in the pluginManagement section of the pom
(or just stuff the properties on the command line in the script instead).

Profiles are (almost) always the wrong solution,
/Anders

Also, you can define a fileNameMapping to drop the version number
http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-war-plugin/examples/file-name-mapping.html
That way, new versions will erase old versions.

It would be helpful to have a link to a single class file with a main method
to run an example of this.  I couldn't get this code to work.

Also, a link to the dependencies necessary.  How many jars does this code
use and what are the links?

Subject: How can I scan arbitrary pom.xml files for conformance to a parent

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

My high level goal is to tell a continuous integration server to report
projects that don't conform to the configuration specified by a parent pom.
I'd like a report for projects that override the parent configuration, or
neglecting to reference the parent pom correctly.

Is there some kind of Maven pom.xml linter that can do this? grep'ing for
"parent" is a start, but it wouldn't check that the snippet was written
correctly.

How about writing a custom enforcer for enforce plugin [1] ?

Subject: Issue with maven antrun in <build> and in <profile> tag
From: Tester <spamcmon@gmail.com>

We are having an issue on our project, where a maven build is executed with
an antrun plugin execution in both the <build> and <profile> tags, it gets
messed up. Let's take this example to illustrate the problem (very
simplified version):

<project>

...

<build>
   <plugins>
<plugin>
<groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
<artifactId>maven-antrun-plugin</artifactId>
<configuration>
<tasks>
... deploy to weblogic server ..
</tasks>
</configuration>
<executions>
<execution>
<phase>deploy</phase>
<goals>
<goal>run</goal>
</goals>
</execution>
</executions>
</plugin>
</plugins>
</build>
<profiles>
<profile>
<id>intg</id>
<build>
<plugins>
<plugin>
<groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
<artifactId>maven-antrun-plugin</artifactId>
<configuration>
<tasks>
... replace a value in file ...
</tasks>
</configuration>
<executions>
<execution>
<id>0_resource</id>
<phase>process-resources</phase>
<goals>
<goal>run</goal>
</goals>
</execution>
</executions>
</plugin>
</plugins>
</build>
</profile>
</profiles>

Now the problem that we are having is that when we do for example: mvn
clean install -Pintg, it first executes the antrun plugin tasks specified
in the build tags. Even though it has a deploy phase. When I would delete
the antrun plugin in the profile tag, I would not have this issue. It seems
that as there are 2 different instances of the antrun plugin, it somehow
executes all of them even though they are not in the appropriate phase.

What is happening here? Is this a bug? Is it not allowed to have 2 antrun
plugins in the same execution of the pom.xml file? I know for example that
it is not a problem to have the antrun plugin in a different profile, as
long as they are not both called!

Apparently it is also not allowed to have 2 antrun plugins defined in the
<build> tag, but you should define multiple <executions> with different
phases.

Could someone please elaborate on this?

You have the config on plugin level not execution level. So the declaration
in the profile will get the config in the build section add well and
execute that. Execute Maven in debug mode and it should be visible.

Subject: How to filter Project artifacts/dependencies?
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1; format=flowed

X-Virus-Checked: Checked by ClamAV on apache.org

I am writing a Maven plugin which needs to filter a project dependencies 
based criteria like scope, is snapshot, is optional, the groupId, etc...

So, all the Project.getRuntimeArtifacts(), getCompileArtifacts(), etc.. 
are deprecated.

There is still getArtifacts().

But how do you filter a project dependencies efficiently. Yea, I've 
looked at aether but that doesn't seem to be an option since it doesn't 
look like there is a way to account for the project resolved dependencies?

So the question is how do you filter a project dependencies like aether 
can with filters.

Also, why is there no way to ask if a dependency will be in a specific 
scope?

Like if dependency a will be in scope Runtime, Compile and Test.

Hi,

I have requirement to exclude some entries in application.xml during ear
build.

application.xml generated by maven-ear-plugin is as follows

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<application xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee" xmlns:xsi="
http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="
http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee
http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee/application_5.xsd" version="5">
  <description>The EAR packaging for the server side of
Application</description>
  <display-name>ApplicationEAR</display-name>
  <module>
    <java>Alpha.jar</java>
  </module>
  <module>
    <ejb>Beta.jar</ejb>
  </module>
  <module>
    <ejb>Theta.jar</ejb>
  </module>
  <module>
    <web>
      <web-uri>Delta.war</web-uri>
      <context-root>/Delta/root</context-root>
    </web>
  </module>
</application>

With EAR structure
  ApplicationEAR
   |--Alpha.jar
   |--Beta.jar
   |--Theta.jar
   |--Delta.jar


In my case I need to maintain the same EAR structure in the build but have
to exclude entries Alpha.jar and Beta.jar from application.xml during build.

How can I achive the same?

I believe you handle scope via the Mojo annotation [1]. Have a look at*
 requiresDependencyResolution.*

Thanks for report.
But testing with wget here and on a machine located in US.
So no problem.

You can use requiresDependencyResolution (as Anders mentioned below) to =
choose the initial scope of what gets populated into =
project.getArtifacts

You can also use maven-common-artifact-filters to filter those artifacts =
further by scope, groupId, artifactId, etc:

	=
http://maven.apache.org/shared/maven-common-artifact-filters/project-summa=
ry.html
	=
http://maven.apache.org/shared/maven-common-artifact-filters/apidocs/index=

I am fairly certain you can provide an application.xml rather than
just taking the one that Maven generates for you. Check the
configuration options & documentation for m-ear-p.

Subject: Maven: How can I run/include a class in a jar with the failsafe plugin?
From: Dan Kaplan <dank@mirthcorp.com>

I've made my own test runner for integration tests that I want to execute,
but I've put it in a reusable jar.  I'm trying to tell failsafe to use it
but I'm not sure how to because [the documentation for includes][1] says:

> A list of <include> elements specifying the tests (by pattern) that
should be included in testing. When not specified and when the test
parameter is not specified, the default includes will be

>     <includes>
     <include>**/IT*.java</include>
     <include>**/*IT.java</include>
     <include>**/*ITCase.java</include>
    </includes>

> Each include item may also contain a comma-separated sublist of items,
which will be treated as multiple  <include> entries.
    This parameter is ignored if the TestNG suiteXmlFiles parameter is
specified.

But this test runner is in the classpath, not on the filesystem.  How can I
tell failsafe to use my class runner and only my class runner?

Minor correction:  This isn't a test runner, but a pojo with the @RunWith
annotation on it.

Hi Dan,

Is this the JUnit annotation, that you mean? And your tests use it to =
refer to a test runner?

Your description is a bit confusing, since in JUnit, you use the =
@RunWith annotation on a test class to refer to another class which IS a =
test runner. You don't annotate a POJO with it, as far as I can tell.

Now if you do mean a test runner that your test classes are referring =
to, you just need to make it  a maven artifact and add it to your test =
dependencies.

Regards,
Russ

Yeah this is a JUnit annotation.
http://junit.sourceforge.net/javadoc/org/junit/runner/RunWith.html  I am
passing in
http://junit.sourceforge.net/javadoc/org/junit/runners/AllTests.html into
that annotation.  org.junit.runners.AllTests is a test runner.  It calls
the suite() method on the pojo I've created.  I'm trying to figure out how
to say, "run this suite" in maven even though the class is in a jar.  I
only want to run this suite.  But "includes" only lets me specify file
patterns instead of classpath patterns, as far as I can tell.

OK, so you're doing something a bit unusual - is there some particular =
reason that you are not compiling these tests in the project where you =
want to run them? That's the usual way, and everything is set up to work =
with that assumption.

But if your tests are built separately by another maven project, all you =
need to do is make the jar that contains the test into a test dependency =
of the project where you want to run it.

The reason is that I want this suite to be reusable.  Its purpose is to
allow different servers to run different integration tests based on the
system properties given when it runs.  It was inspired by this article:
http://blog.tradeshift.com/just-add-servers/

All it does is look for all the integration testss and runs a portion of
them.  This functionality needs to be reused in many projects that have
long running integration tests.

So, "this suite" is a set of tests? Or is it a test runner?

If it's a test runner, and your tests are defined with a @RunWith =
annotation that refers to it, just make it its own maven project and add =
it as a dependency with "test" scope to the projects that contain the =
tests.

Subject: Re: Maven: How can I run/include a class in a jar with the failsafe plugin?

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

RunWith:

 * When a class is annotated with <code>&#064;RunWith</code> or extends a
class annotated
 * with <code>&#064;RunWith</code>, JUnit will invoke the class it
references to run the
 * tests in that class instead of the runner built into JUnit. We added
this feature late
 * in development. While it seems powerful we expect the runner API to
change as we learn
 * how people really use it. Some of the classes that are currently
internal will likely
 * be refined and become public.
 *
 * For example, suites in JUnit 4 are built using RunWith, and a custom
runner named Suite

AllTests:

Runner for use with JUnit 3.8.x-style AllTests classes
 * (those that only implement a static <code>suite()</code>
 * method). For example:
 * <pre>
 * &#064;RunWith(AllTests.class)
 * public class ProductTests {
 *    public static junit.framework.Test suite() {
 *       ...
 *    }
 * }

So this class will use AllTests as a runner.  All tests will call the
suite() method on this class.  The suite() method collects integration
tests from the classpath and runs them.  I'm sorry I'm not answering
directly, but I can't because I don't know what terminology to use.  I'll
show you some of the code:

@RunWith(AllTests.class)
public class DistributedIntegrationTestRunner {

    private static Logger log =
LoggerFactory.getLogger(DistributedIntegrationTestRunner.class);

    public static TestSuite suite() {
        TestSuite suite = new TestSuite();

        ClassesFinder classesFinder = new
ClasspathFinderFactory().create(true,
                new String[]{".*IntegrationTest.*"},
                new SuiteType[]{SuiteType.TEST_CLASSES},
                new Class[]{Object.class},
                new Class[]{},
                "java.class.path");

        int nodeNumber = systemPropertyInteger("node.number", "0");
        int totalNodes = systemPropertyInteger("total.nodes", "1");

        List<Class<?>> allTestsSorted = getAllTestsSorted(classesFinder);
        allTestsSorted = filterIgnoredTests(allTestsSorted);
        List<Class<?>> myTests = getMyTests(allTestsSorted, nodeNumber,
totalNodes);
        log.info("There are " + allTestsSorted.size() + " tests to choose
from and I'm going to run " + myTests.size() + " of them.");
        for (Class<?> myTest : myTests) {
            log.info("I will run " + myTest.getName());
            suite.addTest(new JUnit4TestAdapter(myTest));
        }

        return suite;
    }


None of my tests use the @RunWith annotation, only this class does.  I
don't think I can add that to the tests because
DistributedIntegrationTestRunner
does not implement Runner so the code won't compile if I put
@RunWith(DistributedIntegrationTestRunner.class) on a test.  Even if it
would work, I don't want to have to put that annotation on every test
because someone will forget and their tests will be silently skipped.

*If* this class is in the same project as the rest of the integration
tests, I can put this in the pom.xml:

            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                <artifactId>maven-failsafe-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>2.12.4</version>
                <executions>
                    <execution>
                        <id>integration-tests</id>
                        <goals>
                            <goal>integration-test</goal>
                            <goal>verify</goal>
                        </goals>
                    </execution>
                </executions>
                <configuration>
                    <includes>

<include>**/DistributedIntegrationTestRunner.java</include>
                    </includes>
                    <skipITs>${skipITs}</skipITs>
                </configuration>
            </plugin>

When I do that, everything works exactly how I want.  But, if I move
DistributedIntegrationTestRunner to a jar, that include no longer finds the
DistributedIntegrationTestRunner.java (because it's not a java file
anymore) and no tests get run.

Hi!

Here is the short version of what I want: I've got a JEE6 webapp with a
web.xml file, where the context-parameter facelets.DEVELOPMENT should be
enabled in development mode but disabled for releases.

My idea to solve this problem is as follows:

1) Define the context parameter in web.xml like this

   <context-param>
      <param-name>facelets.DEVELOPMENT</param-name>
      <param-value>${devel.mode}</param-value>
   </context-param>

2) Configure the maven-resources-plugin to filter web.xml and replace
   ${devel.mode} with the actual value.

3) Make devel.mode a maven-property with it's value being 'true' for
   normal builds and 'false' for a release build.

My questions is, is this a recommended way or should I solve this task
differently?

If this is ok, how could I initialize devel.mode correctly? I was
thinking about a default initialization in the pom.xml and an alternative
initialization via the release-profile. My qualms about this approach
are, that profiles are considered evil for most use-cases.

Many thanks in advance,
- martin

Hi,

You should just override the context-param when deploying on the real
production server.

What do you mean by "override"?

You don't want me to extract the released WAR artifact (which is actually
included in an EAR), modify the web.xml and repackage it. Do you?

Most server allow you to externally override context-param without
modifying the war (which would be even worst than using profiles IMO)
see
http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/config/context.html#Context_Parameters
for
tomcat

I can't find anything for JBoss 7, which is the application-server i use.
If this is not possible, your suggestion doesn't work for me :(

Subject: dependency build-classpath returns wrong order
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

X-Virus-Checked: Checked by ClamAV on apache.org

Hi,
I am using the maven-dependency-plugin version 2.8.
If I run "mvn dependency:build-classpath" for one of my project I get the
correct order of the dependencies, but if I generate the classpath in the
maven build itself of my project then the order is messed up.
The plugin configuration I am using (from the effective pom) is below. 
I also tried using older versions of this plugin. 
Why is the order different for the same project and the same version of the
dependency plugin?

       <plugin>

Subject: how to convert unique snaphot into non-unique snaphot on
 downloading from nexus
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
X-Virus-Checked: Checked by ClamAV on apache.org

Hi,
I am building snapshots artifacts in CI tool Hudson and deploying them into
nexus using distribution management in my pom.xml and Snapshot is getting
replaced by timestamp in final artifact name on uploading into nexus because
non-unique snapshots are no more valid in maven 3, that is fine.

Also, on looking for dependency in nexus repo, it always fetch the latest
snapshot artifact as I can see the time stamp and build number in debug
logs.

But, now the problem that I am facing.

1. in WEB-INF/lib of war file.. dependencies are packaging with timestamp.
2. In my project, I am using plugin to copy flex code into my war file but
that again copy the flex artifact with timestamp. But, I have hard coded the
artifact name in my jsp as gui-flex-14.0-SNAPHOT.swc. Due to this I am
getting blank screen.

So, please let me know is there any way to convert unique snapshot artifacts
into non-unique on downloading from nexus. 

In simple words, I am proposing that the Maven client download a snapshot
artifact named A-1.0.0-20110302.160157-17.jar and then rename it to
A-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar when it stores the file locally.

I tried using that, but it "didn't work".  Probably because "includes"
still looks on the file system?

It should be looking in the class path, not the file system.

Thanks for clarifying about the prerequisite for Maven committer school.  I
asked this question to know if there is any implicit prerequisite like
"Must know,   Maven, Java, JIRA" etc...

I would like to be volunteer for this.  Please guide.

As Stephen says:

...

So find your itch and then scratch it.

If you are already using Maven and there is something you think should
get fixed, then that would be the best place to start.

Try to find your problem in Jira to see if it has already been
reported, and then get to work trying to fix it.

There should be enough documentation on the website to explain how to
setup your development environment and if there is anything unclear
then there is another opportunity to fix that as well.

Hi users,

I was wondering if there was a simple way to achieve the following. I have =
looked at the deploy plugin project pages, searched the mailing list and in=
terwebs and I can't find examples of what I am trying to do or a possible m=
ethod for me to achieve it.

I use maven to upload software to a nexus repository, no fancy tricks just =
jars and wars put into snapshot and release repositories.
I have written a small app which collates data about where artifacts have b=
een deployed and what tests have been run against them.

My problem is this. I want to store the full nexus url of artifacts in my o=
ther app, to use as the main reference for data about them. I started writi=
ng a maven plugin to achieve this (passing the URL in an HTML post as data)=
 but I can't find a way to get the deploy URL which is used during the depl=
oy phase of the maven build.

I thought about constructing the url myself as the pattern is formulaic, bu=
t it involves timestamps, which if I generate again will be different to th=
e real ones.

If anyone knows a way to achieve this or can share examples of a way it has=
 been done. I would be most appreciative.

Regards

Adam D

I have been able to understand where the issue is, but not how to solve it.
The wrong classpath is generated when I use the configuration property
"excludeScope=provided".

So if I run:
mvn dependency:build-classpath 
I get the correct classpath, but if I run:
mvn dependency:build-classpath -DexcludeScope=provided
then the classpath has a weird order that doesn't correspond to the
dependency tree.

Is this a known bug of the dependency plugin?

These are not the droids you are looking for...

Also, this is not the problem you want to solve... Nexus Pro has this nice
feature called staging whereby the URL you deploy to is not the same URL
that people download from. I know Artifactory has similar features.

The final nail in the coffin is that very often the deployment repository
is not configured as the download repository, as you deploy into an
internal repository but download from a group proxying repository (so that
you get fast builds by only asking 1 repository)

For the 99% the deploy URL is not the same as the download URL, so the best
you can do is query the attached artifact to determine the timestamp that
was used (for -SNAPSHOT deployment) and then construct the URL based off
the configured download URL that you expect to be downstream from where you
made your deployment

Thanks for your reply Stephen,

So, in my case at least, things are pretty simple....

- No nexus pro. So no staging or other middle man type repos.
- No repository grouping. Releases is releases and snapshots is snapshots
(we have restrictions on who can access what and setting up groups made
this harder to manage effectively.

My builds upload to
http://nexus.mycompany/content/repositories/repo_name/group/artifact/versio
n/artifact.jar

Then production deployment will reference
http://nexus.mycompany/content/repositories/repo_name/group/artifact/versio
n/artifact.jar to get it on the environment.

I agree that people with more complicated setups (involving proxies,
staging repos, groups and non-nexus) will not find this so useful but I
still find it hard to believe that no one else has wanted to pass a
download url of an artifact from one build to another, maybe as a
parameter in a deployment script for instance.

The build process outputs the full URL to the console during the build.

[INFO] [deploy:deploy {execution: default-deploy}]
[INFO] Retrieving previous build number from deploy-snapshots
Uploading:=20
http://nexus.mycompany/content/repositories/repo_name/group/artifact/versio
n/artifact.jar
4/7757K

...

So the URL is constructed somewhere in the maven execution to be used by
the deploy phase. Even if you can only point me to the maven deploy code
which does the construct, that would be helpful.

You are using a sub-optimal repository manager setup then. you should be

For plugins intended for reporting, it would be nice if users could
configure their dependencies directly in the <reporter><plugins><plugin>,
rather than having to write a dummy <build><plugins><plugin>. This would
simplify configuring cobertura-maven-plugin for sun tool dependencies, for
example.

I have continued to dig into the code in order to try and find a potential =
answer wo my question.

The mvane deploy plugin code
https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/maven/plugins/trunk/maven-deploy-plugin<ht=
tps://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/maven/plugins/trunk/maven-deploy-plugin/src/=
main/java/org/apache/maven/plugin/deploy/DeployMojo.java>

Probably contains the info I am looking for, or at least the method by whic=
h to consistently generate the info. I have also come across the shade plug=
in. Which seems to override the default behaviour of other plugins for its =
own purposes. I am thinking that maybe my maven plugin could override a por=
tion of the standard deploy plugin in order to expose the information I req=
uire. Or maybe I am talking about two plugins now, an extension to 'deploy'=
 to expose the required info in a ${project.finalRepoUploadURL} way and a s=
econd plugin to take that info and send it to my apps rest endpoint.

Thanks in advance.

Subject: passing the deployed artifact URL to another system

Hi users,

I was wondering if there was a simple way to achieve the following. I have =
looked at the deploy plugin project pages, searched the mailing list and in=
terwebs and I can't find examples of what I am trying to do or a possible m=
ethod for me to achieve it.

I use maven to upload software to a nexus repository, no fancy tricks just =
jars and wars put into snapshot and release repositories.
I have written a small app which collates data about where artifacts have b=
een deployed and what tests have been run against them.

My problem is this. I want to store the full nexus url of artifacts in my o=
ther app, to use as the main reference for data about them. I started writi=
ng a maven plugin to achieve this (passing the URL in an HTML post as data)=
 but I can't find a way to get the deploy URL which is used during the depl=
oy phase of the maven build.

I thought about constructing the url myself as the pattern is formulaic, bu=
t it involves timestamps, which if I generate again will be different to th=
e real ones.

If anyone knows a way to achieve this or can share examples of a way it has=
 been done. I would be most appreciative.

Regards

Adam D

There is a free version of nexus available; it is quite easy to =
configure. Why do you want to avoid the tools with which maven works =
best? A repository manager of some kind is a basic assumption of much of =
the way maven users work. It seems as though you are going out of your =
way to make it hard for yourself.

Hi Russell, Adam & everyone,

He already said he is using Nexus. And anyway, "use Nexus" does not address
his actual question.

Personally I would like a little more information before passing judgment
about what you are trying to achieve.

The thing about distributed repositories across the Internet is: there is
no one central index of all of them. (http://mvnrepository.com/ tries but
it is only a few of them. It can't possibly know about all of them,
especially non-public ones.)

If I understand correctly, you are trying to derive a remote repository
path from a GAV. Is that correct? Firstly, I will second what Stephen
pointed out: the deploy path (i.e., for upload) is not the same thing as
the resolution path (i.e., for downloading again later). I am guessing your
application actually cares about where these artifacts (and their POMs) can
be downloaded, rather than what path was actually used at deploy time.

If so, is there something wrong with simply having a hardcoded list of
repository base URLs, from which you can scan for the GAVs? That's pretty
much what Maven does with its <repositories> elements.

Regards,
Curtis

Hi,

I'm very new to maven so I have no idea what's causing this error. I
have a sample application and I type "mvn clean install -U", which
seems to grab all dependencies except one:

[WARNING] The POM for
org.springframework.osgi:servlet-api.osgi:jar:2.5-SNAPSHOT is missing,
no dependency information available

Because of this, building my project eventually has an error:

support in Eclipse.


To get this update, simply specify the version in your project's plugin
configuration:

<plugin>

      <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>

      <artifactId>sqlj-maven-plugin</artifactId>

      <version>1.2</version>

</plugin>

Release Notes:

** Bug * [MSQLJ-11] - Wrong web access url for scm * [MSQLJ-13] - sqlj:sqlj
fails if status param is configured to false ** Improvement * [MSQLJ-6] -
Make plugin m2e compatible * [MSQLJ-12] - Print out the version of sqlj
being used * [MSQLJ-14] - Rework how the output of processing (status) info
works ** Task * [MSQLJ-7] - Convert ITs to maven-invoker-plugin * [MSQLJ-8]
- Switch to Mojo Java annotations

Enjoy,

The Mojo team.

Hi Curtis,

A little bit more background information. I hope this illustrates better
what I am trying to achieve.

The tool I am writing is not another repository of actual software or any
of the information already stored in nexus (SHA1's etc.) but a database of
extra metadata about deployable artifacts that nexus doesn't already store
using the absolute URL as a key. It is focused on deployments of my
companies own software. It will not be trying to store data on third party
jars which, as you correctly point out, I can't hope to maintain an index
for all that and with nexus running a proxy group for optimal access to
all the external repos the devs use, the resolved download location could
be different in each case.

If by remote repository path you mean maven central or other externally
host location, no I am not trying to do that. This is only for my locally
hosted internal release repository which contains a finite set of known
projects. I don't really want to guess at the path based on GAV as I will
have to make assumptions about the repo location which means hard coding
it which, in turn, means more maintenance should I change the nexus
service in some way. As I see it, the maven deploy has code takes all this
into account when it is building the artifact. So I don't want to reinvent
the wheel, just take advantage of code that already does what I want, but
doesn't expose it in a way I can currently use.

The tools database will contain the fully resolved nexus URL of an
artefact:
http://nexus.mycompany/content/repositories/repo_name/group/artifact/versio
n/artifact.jar

Not an interpreted route to the artefact:
http://nexus.mycompany/service/local/artifact/maven/resolve?g=3Dgroup&a=3Da=
rtif
act&v=3D1.2.3&r=3Drepo_name&e=3Djar

The absolute URL of the artefact is used by our deployment scripts to
download the artefact it wants to deploy. I am going to make our
deployment scripts query the new application to check for certain flags
(smoke tested, etc.) before allowing the deploy to proceed.


To that end I need to populate the database as new items get built. My
thought was to use maven to do this as (at build time) maven knows the
absolute URL of the artifact. Or at least it gives the impression it does
as it displays it in the console during the deploy phase.

> [INFO] [deploy:deploy {execution: default-deploy}]
> [INFO] Retrieving previous build number from deploy-snapshots
> Uploading:
>=20
>http://nexus.mycompany/content/repositories/repo_name/group/artifact/versi
>o
> n/artifact.jar


If there is an alternative way to achieve this I am open to any
suggestions. For instance maybe I should write a script which runs from
the nexus box and fires off constructed URLs to a rest endpoint as the
file system changes. But this doesn't seem as elegant a solution as a
maven based one.

Regards

Adam D

I would implement this by managing the extra metadata in Nexus. Nexus Pro
has support for this and if you think it is easier and/or cheaper to
implement this support yourself you can do so through a Nexus plugin.
Just so we don't start a repo manager war here, Artifactory also has the
same support (I believe it also requires the commercial version, but I
could be wrong).

So I would be tagging the artifacts in Nexus with QA status etc. And then
have the deploy tool query this before pushing to production. The deploy
tool could then even add even more metadata in Nexus stating when it was
put into production.
The deploy tool would need to know about the URL to a repo group in Nexus
where it can find artifacts to deploy. It should NOT have to look in
multiple repos, but just one single repo (group). The content of the repo
group is managed in Nexus. When retrieving an artifact from Nexus, the tool
should have to use the fully resolved URL. That's just a pain to create
when you can use the much simpler REST services available in Nexus where
you provide the GAV coordinates for example.

Any further questions on Nexus and Nexus plugin development should be
addressed to the Nexus users list, not this list. Use some Internet search
engine to find info about that list.

Hi Robert,

I don't see the artifact you want in the repository you listed. I don't =
see it in Maven Central, either. So:

1) What makes you think such an artifact exists? It looks to me as =
though all of the spring artifacts have names beginning with =
"spring-osgi"
2) Why are you trying to use a snapshot? Prefer the releases unless you =
have some specific reason to look for unreleased features.

Regards,
Russ

HI Adam,

I'd think this would be easier to handle using the artifacts' GAV =
coordinates directly rather than the remote URL. Those should be =
predictable and you'd probably use Maven to download them anyway. So why =
not use the coordinates as your key?

Hi Robert,

spring-web-osgi 1.1.2 is depending on org.springframework.osgi:
servlet-api.osgi:jar:2.5-SNAPSHOT which is rather surprising (A release
should never contains any snapshot, and even more considering it is on
maven central)

I would try to update spring-web-osgi to 1.2.0 which does not seems to
suffer from the same problem.

Hi Russ,
Can you specify individual timestamped snapshots in a GAV based request?

Anders,
I will look into the nexus pro/plugin | Artifactory route, thanks.

Adam D

individual timestamped snapshots? No.=20

I clearly do not understand your goals, here. In general, you cannot get =
at older snapshots via maven, so I don't understand why keeping =
information on it is useful.

Hello,

I can across a problem, which is perfectly described on
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14846436/maven-assembly-plugin-usetransitivedependencies-not-working

Regardless of using
<useTransitiveDependencies>false</useTransitiveDependencies> plug-in seems
to pick-up entire tree of dependencies. I have checked the plug-in code and
found that AddDependencySetsTask#resolveDependencyArtifacts(DependencySet)
seems to ignore the useTransitiveDependencies of dependencySet.

Is it a bug? do I overlook something?

With regards,
Viktor

Subject: Blacklisting during Dependency Location
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
X-Virus-Checked: Checked by ClamAV on apache.org


I am trying to use the site goal but some of our internal repositories 
are getting blacklisted as being "invalid."  There are no network 
issues, I can access the repository just fine and it downloads 
dependencies as needed.  I don't want to disable this feature.  How do I 
actually make it work?

I have two internal nexus repositories, one works, the other doesn't.

repo1 (works) - on my local laptop, mega default setup.

repo2 (blacklisted) - corporate network, connected via VPN, setup like a 
real repository.  Requires login.

Everything in the output of mvn -e -X site seems to look fine clear up 
until it says the repo is invalid and blacklisted.  The site report is 
completed.  Going to the Dependency Location web page and clicking on 
the link provided for the blacklisted repo pops up the exected login 
prompt and then displays the repository.

I suspect, the reason repo2 gets blacklisted by the dependency location 
part of the site goal is because it requires a login and is not using 
the server information in the settings.xml.

While I know there is no network issue, I would not rule out repo2 being 
malconfigured.  I just can't figure out where to start looking.

As I said, I really want this feature to work so disabling it with 
-Ddependency.locations.enabled=false is "uninteresting."

Are you saying that it takes a login to see the dependencies? So once =
you login, you are presented with a set of directories?

Or possibly you are pointing to the control address rather than the =
dependency address?

Must login to see the dependencies.  So in the settings.xml we have a 
<repositories> section to define the repository location and a <server> 
section to match the repository id with a username and password.

Hi Robert,

In all of the repositories I've seen, you never had to login to see =
dependencies. They were always publicly readable; logging in was always =
just to control who could upload. I suspect that your repository is =
misconfigured.

Our corporate internal repo needs a login for read access, and we have no
issues when people use the settings.xml that I tell them to use!

None of the transitive dependencies of spark are in the classpath. It
generally happens if the POM is "invalid".
What does "mvn dependency:tree" says? Is there any error/warning in IDEA?

So it is even weirder than I thought.  I cleared the .m2 cache and typed 
mvn compile install, then mvn site and it worked!  Then I typed mvn site 
again and it failed (blacklisted to repo).  That doesn't even make sense 
to me.  If I clear the m2 cache and do a mvn install again, it 
repopulates the .m2 cache and typing mvn site then works.  Typing mvn 
site again fails.  So far it seems for all the world like I have to 
clear the .m2 cache everytime in order to run mvn site.

Trying hard to make that makes sense, so any other thoughts would be 
appreciated...

Hi Robert,

long time ago, I had similar issue. Try adding this snipplet to your
pom.xml
The version of the plugin might not be the latest, but it worked for me
(back then):

  <reporting>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <artifactId>maven-project-info-reports-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>2.2</version>
        <configuration>
          <dependencyLocationsEnabled>false</dependencyLocationsEnabled>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </reporting>

Cheers,
Ziga Gregoric

The problem with this is this tag 'dependencyLocationsEnabled' tag being 
set to false.  This is the most common solution people post but it 
"works" through the simple exedient of disabling the feature.

I might try putting this in minus that tag though.  Perhaps explicitly 
stating the version will help because that is one of the warnings it 
croaks about....

I would love to hear/see details.  Any chance of posting a scrubbed 
settings.xml and sample pom?

Right now, the only consistent way I can make 'mvn site' is to clear the 
cache first which is pretty much a non-starter.

Subject: mvn-eclipse-plugin problem with pde projects and linked resources
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
X-Virus-Checked: Checked by ClamAV on apache.org

Hello,

I just took over the maintenance of several OSGi bundles.  I added the 
mvn-eclipse-plugin to the POM files for each of the bundles because I'd 
like to generate the necessary Eclipse project files to work with the 
source code and use the OSGi Framework launcher in the Eclipse IDE:

<plugin>
<artifactId>maven-eclipse-plugin</artifactId>
<version>2.9</version>
<configuration>
<pde>true</pde>
</configuration>
</plugin>

For reasons I don't understand, running "mvn eclipse:eclipse" generates 
a .project file with an incomplete set of linked resources.  For 
example, I have a POM file for one of the bundles that has the following 
3 dependencies:

<dependency>
  <groupId>log4j</groupId>
  <artifactId>log4j</artifactId>
  <version>1.2.17</version>
  </dependency>

<dependency>
<groupId>org.apache.felix</groupId>
<artifactId>org.apache.felix.main</artifactId>
<version>4.2.1</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
<groupId>com.jgoodies</groupId>
<artifactId>looks</artifactId>
<version>2.2.2</version>
</dependency>

The generated .project file for this bundle only has one linked resource 
to one of the artifacts:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<projectDescription>
   <name>org.protege.common</name>
   <comment>Core Protege Libraries. NO_M2ECLIPSE_SUPPORT: Project files

     </link>
   </linkedResources>
</projectDescription>

When I try to import the existing PDE project into Eclipse, I get 
compiler errors since the other two artifacts aren't listed as linked 
resources.

Is there something I'm missing about how to properly use this plug-in?  
I'm using Maven version 3.1.0.  Any help and/or advice would be very 
much appreciated.

Jennifer

I use pde + maven-bundle-plugin + osgi framework launcher but i don't use 
mvn-eclipse-plugin. You should be using m2e, which works completely 
different than m-eclipse-p. Just do a final eclipse:clean and forget about 
that plugin. 

Then make sure that your eclipse has m2e (comes by default with any recent 
eclipse) and do a File > import > maven > Existing Maven project if your 
project is already in the filesystem. If not choose "checkout maven 
project from SCM" instead

good luck

a .project file with an incomplete set of linked resources.  For 
example, I have a POM file for one of the bundles that has the following 
3 dependencies:

<dependency>
  <groupId>log4j</groupId>
  <artifactId>log4j</artifactId>
  <version>1.2.17</version>
  </dependency>

<dependency>
<groupId>org.apache.felix</groupId>
<artifactId>org.apache.felix.main</artifactId>
<version>4.2.1</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
<groupId>com.jgoodies</groupId>
<artifactId>looks</artifactId>
<version>2.2.2</version>
</dependency>

The generated .project file for this bundle only has one linked resource 
to one of the artifacts:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<projectDescription>
   <name>org.protege.common</name>
   <comment>Core Protege Libraries. NO_M2ECLIPSE_SUPPORT: Project files

     </link>
   </linkedResources>
</projectDescription>

When I try to import the existing PDE project into Eclipse, I get 
compiler errors since the other two artifacts aren't listed as linked 
resources.

Is there something I'm missing about how to properly use this plug-in? 
I'm using Maven version 3.1.0.  Any help and/or advice would be very 
much appreciated.

Jennifer

Hello Alejandro,

Thank you very much for the reply, but there is something I don't 
understand.

I'm using Eclipse Kepler, which has m2e.  I tried what you suggested.  
Importing as existing Maven projects works very well, with all 
dependencies detected and no compilation errors.  However, since Eclipse 
sees these as Maven projects rather than PDE projects, I'm unable to 
create a new Runnable of type OSGi Framework in the Run Configurations 
dialog.  Eclipse doesn't detect my projects as bundles.

How are you able to create Runnables with the OSGi Framework launcher?  
Any guidance is very much appreciated.

Best,
Jennifer

it all depends if you are going the maven bundle plugin route (which is 
POM-centric and the manifest is auto generated) or manifest first, where 
the manifest is generated by hand (eclipse tooling helps with this though) 
and the pom is also generated by hand but it has a much smaller role (to 
be exact, there is a way to generate the pom, but you generate it once and 
manage it by hand after, whereas in the first way you never manage the 
manifest and it gets regenerated every time you build, in fact, you don't 
even commit the manifest in your VCS). The major difference is where are 
the dependencies managed. So this is the first decision you will need to 
make, if you haven't already made it
https://docs.sonatype.org/display/TYCHO/OSGiDevelopmentWithMaven
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11373009/should-i-use-pom-first-or-manifest-first-when-developing-osgi-application-with-m

For the launcher to recognize the project as a bundle I think you just 
need the META-INF folder in the root of the project with an osgi-friendly 
MANIFEST.MF inside

I'm not sure what you mean by Runnables, you mean a new launcher? the fact 
that you capitalise it makes me think of the java interface, but i don't 
see the connection

Subject: Maven shade plugin: Retaining origin file timestamps

Hello,

I am currently using maven shade plugin to package a project jar that would
contain some java libraries as well as some clojure libraries. After some
investigation into load time  performance issue, I found that maven shade
plugin default behaviour is to re-write or create the files, which means
new timestamps will be present in jar for all the files. This generally
wouldn't have been a problem if it is just Java files. Clojure compilation
current behaviour is that if two files - one clojure, one java file have
the same timestamp then it would give clojure file priority and would
compile it on the fly. For example, if a.clj and a corresponding a.class is
present with equal timestamps then clojure would think that a.clj is newer
and would compile it. This is causing all the clojure files to be compiled
again and thus causing jar load time to increase.

Is there a workaround to overcome this default behaviour from
maven-shade-plugin ?

Thanks,
Kranthi

Hi,

I was trying to use the moduleSets/binaries to get all my Flex Modules and
their runtime locales packed.
It works fine launch from the parent module but not from the parent's parent
module:

Failed to execute goal
org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-assembly-plugin:2.4:single (make-assembly) on
project Distribution: Failed to create assembly: Error creating assembly
archive modules: You must set at least one file.

+parent module
    |
    + parent FlexModules
        |
        +Module1
        +DistributionModule

Module1 generates artifacts with classifiers for the locales, so, I've got
module1.swf, module1_en_US.swf and so on.

The DistributionModule is where I use the assembly plugin to pack my
modules:

    <build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <artifactId>maven-assembly-plugin</artifactId>

                        </goals>

<descriptor>src/assembly/distro.xml</descriptor>
                            </descriptors>
                        </configuration>
                    </execution>
                </executions>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>

And my assembly:

Is there a way to make it work from the parent's parent module and
eventually make it simpler ?

Thanks,
-Fred

I'm using the maven-bundle-plugin for all of the OSGi bundles, so the 
manifest files are regenerated every time I build.  I don't have any 
manifest files committed in our source code repository.  I suppose this 
means I'm using the "POM first" approach.

Thank you for this pointer.  I manually created META-INF folders at the 
root of each project and placed copies of the generated MANIFEST.MF 
files in the folders.  Eclipse now recognizes projects as bundles.

Sorry, yes - I meant that I wanted to create an OSGi Framework 
launcher.  I was able to start the process now that Eclipse recognized 
my projects as bundles:



Oddly, the bundles run fine outside of the Eclipse environment.  My 
first few attempts at using the OSGi Framework launcher has left me with 
a slew of ClassNotFoundException errors at runtime.  Will need to 
investigate this further.

Thanks for your help in getting me this far along.

Best,
Jennifer

~/M101J$ mvn --version
Apache Maven 3.0.4
Maven home: /usr/share/maven

Default locale: en_US, platform encoding: UTF-8
OS name: "linux", version: "3.8.0-31-generic", arch: "amd64", family: "unix"


strange thing I observed is when I went on the command line and invoke mvn
compile , it failed with

~/M101J/src/main/java/com/tengen/HelloWorldSparkStyle.java:[19,10] error:
annotations are not supported in -source 1.3

made me think what if I generated the project from intellij - this time it
worked. I had previously generated the project directly on command line and
imported it into intelliJ and that seem to be the reason why it was not
working well.

thank you all for your pointers. this one stumps me.

Did you by any chance install using apt-get? I've seen a number of cases =
where doing so leads to errors like this. Try installing manually from =
the website.

To be clear, Russell is asking if you "installed Maven using apt-get
rather than downloading the tarball from the Maven website and
manually installing it."

It is true that we see "odd" problems on this list from time to time
from people who have installed a package OTHER than the one hosted on
maven.apache.org.

At this point (with the dependency specifically declared in the pom),
you have to start questioning everything:
1. are you sure that's the right dependency declaration and version?
sometimes projects "move" and start producing new versions under a
different groupId.
2. are you sure org.slf4j.LoggerFactory is supposed to be in that jar
with that version?
3. go into .m2 and find the slf4j-api-1.7.5.jar file, open it up with
a zip tool, confirm it is a real jar (zip) and not HTML error message
4. also confirm it has org.slf4j.LoggerFactory inside
5. consider if you really want the API or an implementation package
for runtime use

Hi all,

> for runtime use

The typical pattern with SLF4J is to depend only on org.slf4j:slf4j-api at
compile time, and then add an implementation binding at runtime. For SLF4J
1.6+, you don't even need an implementation at runtime; it will default to
no-op with only a single one-line warning. You have to be careful though:
it's best to add the implementation binding only for end-user application
components (i.e., components not intended for reuse), and/or add the
dependency non-transitively using test or optional scope; see:

    http://slf4j.org/faq.html#maven2

Anyway, I know that's a tangent from the original topic. It seems the OP
doesn't care about SLF4J; it's just a transitive dependency which should
get pulled in.

> Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError:
org/slf4j/LoggerFactory

Personally, I cannot reproduce this problem on my OS X 10.9 system. The
exact POM and Java source posted works for me from both the command line
and using IntelliJ IDEA 12.1.6 downloaded today.

So I agree with Wayne to start double-checking your assumptions. See if
"mvn" works on the command line, "mvn dependency:tree" or "dependency:list"
as suggested by others, maybe try in NetBeans and/or Eclipse... and if your
IntelliJ is old try upgrading it and reimporting the project from scratch.

Regards,
Curtis

Hey everyone,

I'm trying to understand something basic, I haven't been able to find
the answer through Google surprisingly (maybe my searching abilities
suck today). How is it that Maven is able to find source code to
compile? What I would expect is the pom.xml to refer to some *.java
path (something like <source>src/main/java/*</source>), but I don't
see anything like that.

How does maven know what java source code to compile? Thanks in
advance for any help.

You are likely not see "src/main/java" in POMs because that is the default
path. Unless you want to change the source directory, you can omit it
altogether.

Maven has a 'convention over configuration' philosophy, which means that th=
e pom.xml doesn't need to specify paths that are in the conventional places=
=2E  So unless otherwise configured, it will look in src/main/java for all =
of it's (non-test) source code.  You should be able to find the conventions=
 listed on the maven site, or the site for a particular plug-in.
=20
I find this very helpful in creating minimalist pom.xml files for the stand=
ard 'make me a jar, test, document, and put it some where it can be found' =
process.  But it can be a pain if you don't know where the conventional pla=
ces are, and any deviation often results in a great multitude of google sea=
rches to find the man behind the curtain.

Hey everyone,

 I'm trying to understand something basic, I haven't been able to find
 the answer through Google surprisingly (maybe my searching abilities
 suck today). How is it that Maven is able to find source code to
 compile? What I would expect is the pom.xml to refer to some *.java
 path (something like <source>src/main/java/*</source>), but I don't
 see anything like that.
=20
 How does maven know what java source code to compile? Thanks in

mvn help:effective-pom will spit out the pom made up of the defaults plus
anything you've overridden or added.  Stand back; it's huge.

If you have a look at the effective pom, which is what Maven uses, you will
see a sourceDirectory element in the build section. The default path is
defined in the Super-POM.

You can view the effective pom in m2e or with "mvn help:effective-pom".

Thanks everyone, super helpful information. I'm still learning so I
appreciate you putting up with my silly newbie questions :)

I'll try to ramp up on the conventional aspects of maven, that seems
to be the missing piece.

There is no pom.xml in this directory. Should it be trying to build a

Oh I understand now, sorry I thought it was a sample POM or something :-)

Works when I step into my project directory and run it. Thanks!

The easy way to figure out what is happening is to use Eclipse/STS as 
your IDE and then you have nice gui tools that will tell you where your 
sources are supposed to be.
It is free and comes ready to build with maven.
It has a nice editor for pom files and a window that shows you what you 
effective POM is and another that shows you your whole maven dependency 
tree with nice little notes about version conflicts and which one Maven 
has selected for your pleasure.

I think I speak for most of us when I say: after mastering maven, we find p=
lenty of other things to be newbies at.  So we're all in different instance=

Thanks everyone, super helpful information. I'm still learning so I
 appreciate you putting up with my silly newbie questions :)

 I'll try to ramp up on the conventional aspects of maven, that seems
 to be the missing piece.

So my goal right now is to generate an Eclipse project for my maven
project. I successfully have done this using:

mvn eclipse:eclipse

Now in my Activator.java file I am adding a new dependency:

import org.restsql.core.Config;

Eclipse tells me it cannot resolve "org.restsql". So what I did was
use install:install-file to install restSQL:

mvn install:install-file
-Dfile=C:\Users\rdailey\Downloads\restsql-0.8.6.jar
-DgroupId=org.restsql -DartifactId=restsql -Dversion=0.8.6
-Dpackaging=jar

This seems to have gone well:

[INFO] --- maven-install-plugin:2.5.1:install-file (default-cli) @
repository ---
[INFO] pom.xml not found in restsql-0.8.6.jar
[INFO] Installing C:\Users\rdailey\Downloads\restsql-0.8.6.jar to
C:\maven-repo\org\restsql\restsql\0.8.6\restsql-0.8.6.jar
[INFO] Installing
C:\Users\rdailey\AppData\Local\Temp\mvninstall5055305258717126807.pom
to C:\maven-repo\org\restsql\restsql\0.8.6\restsql-0.8.6.pom

Now when I go back to my eclipse project, it still can't resolve it.
Am I missing something? If it's in the repo now, shouldn't it resolve?

Hi Robert,

Did you add this to your POM? If so, Eclipse should try to download the =
jar from maven central into your local repo. If you didn't, just putting =
it in the repo probably won't do much.

Also you should not use eclipse:eclipse , this is the old way to work with
eclipse.
Just run eclipse:clean to remove the generated files, and then in eclipse,
import the project as existing maven project. If it has a valid pom.xml, it
will generate and manage the appropriate eclipse files.

I'm not much of an Eclipse user, but if I remember correctly Kepler 
comes with Maven out of the box.

Your mileage may vary (I mostly use NetBeans).

Eclipse/STS from the Spring guys (VMWare now) is an Eclipse IDE with all 
of the plug-ins that you need to develop Java (and more).

We started with pure Eclipse but spent so much time fixing up the 
plug-ins with each new version that it affected our productivity.
Once we found the Spring Tool Suite (Eclipse with all the "right" 
plug-ins) we were in good shape - 1 download and we were back up and 
coding in a few minutes.

I have never used NetBeans so I have no comment about how it helps with 
the original problem(source code location).

Hi,

> if I remember correctly Kepler comes with Maven out of the box.

See this chart for which Eclipse packages include Maven integration:

    http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/compare.php?release=kepler

Personally I use the "Eclipse IDE for Java Developers" which comes with
support for both Maven and Git.

Or as Ron said you can use the Eclipse STS bundle (
http://spring.io/tools/sts), which comes with quite a few additional things
too.

Regards,
Curtis

The web project composed of several modules can be deployed to the 
application server (WAS 8.5.5) and runs as expected, when built within 
eclipse (juno sp2) by the eclipse compiler. The same project built with 
maven, either through the m2e-wtp plugin or with "mvn clean install" from 
the command line, can not be run on the AppServer.

Maven build worked too, but does not anymore for unknown reason. No 
changes of configuration or programs but update of m2e-wtp.

All required configuration files bundled within the resulting project.ear 
are correct and identical to the version compiled with eclipse.
On analyzing the issue it turned out, some classes compiled by maven have 
defective import lists! 
For instance:
A *.class file decompiled with jd has the following import list:
import DocumentId;
import DocumentKind;
import IProject;
import IRequirement;
import java.io.Serializable;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Locale;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.logging.Logger;
import javax.faces.model.SelectItem;
We see, the list is truncated, and some imports have the class name only, 
but no package information.
If we look at the same decompiled class file, but the outcome from the 
eclipse compiler, the list look like:
import ch.commcity.monterosa.common.reports.DocumentId;
import ch.commcity.monterosa.common.reports.DocumentKind;
import ch.commcity.monterosa.ejb.IProject;
import ch.commcity.monterosa.ejb.IRequirement;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.Serializable;
import java.security.InvalidParameterException;
import java.security.Principal;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Locale;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.ResourceBundle;
import java.util.logging.Level;
import java.util.logging.Logger;
import javax.faces.application.Application;
import javax.faces.application.ConfigurableNavigationHandler;
import javax.faces.application.FacesMessage;
import javax.faces.context.ExternalContext;
import javax.faces.context.FacesContext;
import javax.faces.model.SelectItem;
First, the latter list is longer and second the import DocumentId for 
instance  includes the full package path!
As the import list is defective, no surprise all methods look like the 
following example:
  int getFrom()
  {
    throw new Error("Unresolved compilation problem: \n");
  }
instead of:
int getFrom() {
        return this.from;
}
which is neither very sophisticated, but does was is expected to be done.
Question:
All dependencies declarations within the poms are the same as before. May 
a missing declaration be the origin of the problem, which before had no 
effect?
What else? I must say I had the same problem in February of this year, But 
without any conscious change (I suspect after update to sp2 of juno) it 
worked suddenly as now it stopped to work, maybe due to the m2e-wtp 
update!
The poms are unchanged and within the Kepler IDE environment maven 
compiles the code as expected. The only differences are some parts proper 
to the glassfish 3.1.2 Appserver and for the Mojarra version of JSF in 
turn of MyFaces used by WebSphere.
Any hint or suggestion is welcome.

Hi, 
     i am very new to maven. I am trying to import hadoop source code into
eclipse. and for this i followed this link: 
http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/EclipseEnvironment 

in this there are 2 mvn commands: 
 $ mvn install -DskipTests
$ mvn eclipse:eclipse -DdownloadSources=true -DdownloadJavadocs=true


during both command execution i came across following error

[INFO] [enforcer:enforce {execution: default}]
[WARNING] Rule 0: org.apache.maven.plugins.enforcer.RequireMavenVersion
failed with message:
*Detected Maven Version: 2.2.1 is not in the allowed range [3.0.2,).*
[INFO]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
[ERROR] BUILD ERROR
[INFO]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] Some Enforcer rules have failed. Look above for specific messages
explaining why the rule failed.


Highlighted one is main area of interest which i didn't understood.(i have
installed maven2) Please can u help me in solving above query. 

Thank You

Highlights don't get get through when sendig from Nabble.

But the error message is saying that you are using Maven 2.2.1, but you
need to use Maven 3.0.2 or greater. I strongly suggest you use Maven 3.0.4
or 3.0.5.

The people who write the software you are trying to build have decreed that
you need to use a recent version of Maven in order to build correctly. They
have defined an enforcer rule to enforce their minimum maven version
requirement. The enforcer rule has kicked in and failed the build early
because you are using maven version 2.2.1 and the allowed range is [3.0.2,)

Maven has a version range syntax. briefly

[x] means only version x and no other version

[x,y] means any version >=x and <=y

[x,y) means any version >=x and <y

(x,y] means any version >x and <=y

(x,y) means any version >x and <y

(,x] means any version <=x

[x,) means any version >=x

(,x) means any version <x

(x,) means any version >x

FTR, here is the standard requires I add to most of my projects:

                  <requireMavenVersion>

                    <version>(,2.1.0),(2.1.0,2.2.0),(2.2.0,)</version>

                    <message>Maven 2.1.0 and 2.2.0 produce incorrect GPG
signatures and checksums respectively.

                    </message>

                  </requireMavenVersion>

                  <requireMavenVersion>

                    <version>(,3.0),[3.0.4,)</version>

                    <message>Maven 3.0 through 3.0.3 inclusive do not pass
correct settings.xml to Maven Release

                      Plugin.

                    </message>

                  </requireMavenVersion>

Hadoop are not as forgiving as me it would seem

This range lets through any maven version before 2.1.0.
We have not issued a patch version of 2.1.0 to fix the GPG signature issue,
but if we did, it will be innocent until proven guilty
2.2.0 is not allowed, but everything after it is

Everything prior to 3.0 passes the settings.xml correctly
3.0.4 contains the fix and thus everything after will have the fix, or at
least is innocent until proven guilty

I could give one single consolidated range, but then you don't get a nice
message explaining why the specific versions are banned.

This list does not support m2e. You'll need to ask this question on
the appropriate Eclipse list. We can help you sort out why command
line Maven is not working as it should.

Maven (command line) simply calls out to the JDK installed on your
system. You can use "mvn -X" to see the actual command that Maven uses
to call javac. If you are experiencing problems with the output of
Maven's compilation process, your real complaint is with the JDK &
javac itself, not Maven. I trust that you realize that Eclipse has and
uses its own compiler, so I would expect that you might see some
different results when analyzing class files produced by the 2
compilers.

Is it possible that javac simply reduced your import list because a)
they were not all being used or b) it swapped out the import and
replaced the short name for the class with the fully-qualified name?
Did you look at the rest of the source code that came out of jd?

Can you explain how you are copying the artifacts currently? You say =
that your dependencies are being packaged with a timestamp. How are you =
doing this? And then you say that you are copying the flex artifact with =
a plugin. What plugin is that?

I think that you need to explain a bit more what is going on, here.

NetBeans helps quite a lot.  I've been shamefully spoiled by it and
tend to use it even just to browse code when I have no intent to
develop it.  I've used Eclipse (not STS though) and was happy to see
the back of it after losing too much time to plugins-disease.

I hear that IntelliJ is good with Maven projects too.

Maybe it is mustard after the mail (as the Dutch call it. ;) ), but here is
a nice article about the standard directory layout of Maven:

Actually this is quite surprising. I would expect the timestamp to be not
visible to the end user.
You build/deploy a -SNAPSHOT version , you ask for a -SNAPSHOT version, you
get a -SNAPSHOT in your war. Internally maven/nexus may use real timestamp
but this is not supposed to be visible. Whatever you are using to do this
must not do it correctly.

Hi Russell,
I am using maven version 3 and I have configured the maven jobs in Hudson
(mvn clean deploy) to deploy the unique snapshots artifacts into a nexus
hosted repository and for that I have configured distribution management tag
in project parent pom.xml. 
I am using maven-war-plugin to collect all artifact dependencies, classes
and resources of the web application and packaging them into a web
application archive. But, now while packaging I am getting snapshot
dependencies with timestamp in WEB-INF/lib of war file. 
To copy the flex artifacts (swf artifact) into my gui war project, I am
using org.sonatype.flexmojos:flexmojos-maven-plugin: copy-flex-resources
during process-resource phase. But, it again copying flex artifacts with
timestamp.

Hi Amir,

Non-unique snapshot artifacts - without timestamp.
unique snapshot artifact - with timestamp. Maven 3 only support unique
snapshot. In maven 2, we set the <uniqueversion>false</uniqueversion> to
deploy the non-unique snapshot artifacts.

Hi Adrein,

Maven is downloading snapshot dependencies with timestamp into my local
repository. I have timestamp versions of snapshot dependency in my local
repository and the files are getting copied with their standard names.

We could remove clj files from the jar altogether. However, the problem is we
don't know if all the clojure dependencies are AOT compiled. So, some of the
clojure files should be compiled on the fly. The problem is when dynamically

Hi sahil,

That=92s not exactly what I meant. How are your repository tags set up? =
How is your nexus repo configured? Are you certain than Maven is treated =
snapshots as snapshots rather than releases? What commands are you using =
to upload them? Maven should not actually be aware of the time stamps if =
configured properly, I believe. At least not in any way that the user =
should notice.

Thanks,
Russ

You could use this image.



And it actually covers Maven 3.0.4 and above.

Subject: Best Practice for testing code that uses provided dependencies
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1; format=flowed

X-Virus-Checked: Checked by ClamAV on apache.org

We have code that depends on "provided" libraries.

What is the best way to test the code?

I don't particularly want to add the shared libraries to the project 
since they are large and will add a big load into the SCM and make it 
hard to check out the project.

Can I add the dependency twice, once as provided and once as test?
Any comments or suggestions?

Ron

I=92m actually running into the same issue, and my plan was s to take =
advantage of the situation to provide test versions of the classes. What =
I found was that the =93provided=94 dependency wound up in the test =
class path.

So I think that the fact that it is provided should have no impact on =
how you test it.

I am not sure what you mean.
If scope is provided, does that mean that you have to add the jar to the 
project?
Or does "provided" turn out to be like compile when the tests are run?

I guess that Eclipse does not understand that. It can not resolve the 
imports. Not really a maven problem

Yes; if scope is =93provided=94, maven will make sure the jar is =
available on the compile class path as well as the test compile and test =
run class paths; however, anything that depends on your module will not =

It seems to work in IntellijIDEA, though.

Hello Everyone,

 

I am facing strange problem while generating sources from XSD, I am having
multiple modules in my project and some of old modules are using
org.jvnet.jaxb2.maven2 plugin 0.4.M3. New module is using version 0.7.1 of
org.jvnet.jaxb2.maven2 plugin. It works fine while building independently
but fails with existing modules. I suspect that version 0.7.1 is not picked
up at all while building my new module along with others, same has been
confirmed via console output for generate sources.

Maven version : 2.0.10

 Hello,
 you may be interested in adding "Agile ALM" 
 (http://www.manning.com/huettermann/) as well. It covers Maven in many 
 different chapters. In the book, Maven is used as a backbone to set up a 
 comprehensive application lifecycle management. The book provides both 
 the big picture and a lot of details.


 Michael

Thanks Anders for you reply, I upgraded maven to version 2.2.1 and it worked
like a charm :)

Yes, Maven 2.0.10 can't handle different plugin classpaths for the modules.
Either align the versions or (preferably) upgrade to Maven 3.0.4+.

For now, as a work around, I wrote a shell script that after the shading
process rewrites the timestamps of clojure files to sometime in the past. I
am using maven-exec-plugin to run that shell script.

When creating an assembly, I would like the timestamps of each file

Hi,

I have a setup with many users (200 students), each of them having a limited $HOME. I'm looking for a way to provide them the most common plugins and dependencies and save disk space.

Is there a way to have a system-wide (e.g. /usr/share/maven/... or so) repository, where the sysadmin could download stuff that the students wouldn't have to download and store in their $HOME ?

I found many solutions using a proxy, that would allow me to download from the intranet, but these solutions still require a local repository in $HOME/.m2/, so this saves bandwidth but not disk space. I also saw some people advising to set localRepository in their pom.xml, but this does not seem to be a good idea (not thread-safe), and doesn't really solve my issue, as I would like the system-wide repository to be read-only (managed by root only), and to come in addition to $HOME/.m2/, not as a replacement.

Thanks in advance,

Unfortunately, you will always have something in $HOME/.m2/repository
because that's how maven works.

Can I suggest perhaps that you use zfs for deduplication in /home?
Otherwise, you can add something like
-Dmaven.repo.local=3D/tmp/${USER}_repository (with a mkdir -p in their
profile or something to make the directory ahead of time).  I believe this
can be added to MAVEN_OPTS and it would work...

Either way, with 200 students, I would recommend the zfs since there will
be LOTS of duplicated jars.

Making a single local cache is a very bad idea.  there isnt any locking,
so they would clobber each other and get errors.  One student would be
accessing the jar as part of compilation and the other will be
mid-overwriting the jar.  its messy.  Even messier if they change their
umask, and noone can read or write to the location.

So, thats my 2 bits on the topic.

When building a .tar.gz archive with the maven assembly plugin, should 
it not be keeping the timestamps of the files it is adding to the 
archive?  This is how tar behaves.  I find it NOT to be the case with 
the assembly plugin.  The files are dated with the time they were added 
to the archive.  This is not how tar behaves.

Or give them more disk space - isn't this stuff meant to be cheap now-a-days?

If they dont have direct access to the internet, then you can setup a
Maven Repository Manager, to vet/restrict what artifacts they use.

My ~/.m2/repository is 1.2GB but I would expect that to be an upper
limit considering the cruft I have accumulated in there.
Probably time to delete it and reseed from the local Maven Repository Manager,

So back of the envelope calculations say 200 * 1.2GB = 240GB.

Steve,

this does not seem to be possible with the currect discriptor [1].
Please search in JIRA for such a ticket or file one.

Local disk space is cheap. NFS-shared, RAID & backed-up disk space, less
so. I can live with a few Gb of waste, but I was just wondering whether
we could do any better.

They do.

If you can control the version of Maven they run, you could create a aether
plugin that would let you use a tiered set of repositories... at least if I
understand aether correctly... then by putting that in the $MAVEN_HOME/lib
and doing some magic you might be able to at least share the read-only
part... but you would be neck deep in aether to write such a thing... and I
would advise checking with Benjamin to confirm that such a thing is
possible before starting down that road

Hi all,
I'm developing a maven plugin and I want to discover the last version of a
specific artifact. I had a look to the maven-vesions-plugin. But I don't
know why when I try to get a (deprecated) ArtifacteMetadataSource as follow:
   @Component
    private ArtifactMetadataSource artifactMetadataSource

I get an exception:

1) No implementation for
org.apache.maven.repository.legacy.metadata.ArtifactMetadataSource was
bound.

I'm usign Maven 3.0.5 as a model and runtime.
Could somebody help me?

Thanks,

Romain.

Disks are cheap.  But not free.  Running the procurement gantlet is
not free.  Downtime to install new storage is not free.  Lord knows
that additional backup tapes are not free, not even cheap.  Longer
backup windows are not free.  Throwing storage at the problem is often
a reasonable choice, but it's also reasonable to always ask if there
isn't a better way.

Sorry, I've been aching to write that for a long time....

Looking at the *MetadataSource components in the Maven source they're =
only bound under:

	org.apache.maven.artifact.metadata.ArtifactMetadataSource

and not:

	=
org.apache.maven.repository.legacy.metadata.ArtifactMetadataSource

For example in MavenMetadataSource.java:

	import =
org.apache.maven.artifact.metadata.ArtifactMetadataSource;
	// ...

	@Component( role =3D ArtifactMetadataSource.class, hint =3D =
"maven" )
	public class MavenMetadataSource
	    implements ArtifactMetadataSource
	{
	    // ...

So if you change to use =
org.apache.maven.artifact.metadata.ArtifactMetadataSource it should work =
(this is the API supported by both Maven 2.x and 3.x)

Hi all,

There is plenty of room for improvement regarding reuse of Maven's local
repository cache. Releases in particular are supposed to be immutable so
once they are downloaded they could go into a read-only tier as suggested
by Stephen. Inventing such a scheme to reuse large portions of the repo
cache would be of great benefit to the Maven community.

E.g.: the recommended CIS strategy is for every job to use its own local
repo cache, which becomes very large. My Jenkins has dozens of Maven build
jobs and I cannot afford the bloat; my Jenkins backups are huge enough
already. So what I do instead is limit my Maven Jenkins node to a single
executor, which is a real waste on a 16 core machine. Much better would be
if the jobs could share the bulk of the repo cache.

So it's definitely an itch, but not quite itchy enough for anyone to
scratch yet...

:) but like I said, you wouldnt worry about the space if it was all on
zfs.  zfs has built in de-duplication.  you could have 2000 local maven
repos and probably not fill your disk since most of it has to do with
duplicate jars and such.

Hi Roy,

> zfs has built in de-duplication.

ZFS sounds awesome in theory but have you actually tried it? If so, how is
it working for you? In particular, how is the performance?

As others have pointed out, its not possible to do better at the moment.

The students ~/.m2 does not need to be backed-up/NFS/RAID as
everything is generated. Local disk on each machine is fine.  As long
as you have a Maven Repository Manager to cache the central artifacts,
otherwise it will be too slow to re-seed the local Maven cache (i.e.
~/.m2/repository).

I'd put things the student's local Maven cache in /tmp/maven_cache/<userid>.
It doesn't need to survive reboots.
Depending on your level of trust, you will need to write scripts to
scan these directories for unauthorized files being squirreled here.

If you are doing full release cycles then you will also need somewhere
for students to deploy their released artifacts.  The local Maven
cache is not where you deploy these, so its fine for the local cache
to get removed as the released artifacts will be fetched from the
deployed location.

A side benefit of local disk is that you wont get NFS latency and your
builds will continue to work when NFS is flaky.

>> If they dont have direct access to the internet,

Then you need to make sure there is sufficient documentation on how
they should configure Maven, if they are not connecting to their Maven
Repository Manager it will be too slow.
A simple FAQ "Why is Maven slow?" should fix that. And its a natural
penalty for those who cant follow instructions.


If you have advanced students then they might want to attempt to patch
maven so the local cache is thread safe. They'd need to also think
about how to handle failed/stalled downloads correctly so it doesn't
block everyone else using the cache. But you still have the problem
that people working on the same artifacts will be clobbering each
others build output.  So Stephen's suggestion of a "tiered" repository
layout would be necessary. And as Curtis points out it is something
that would be useful, especially for Jenkins, At the very least,
writing up some thoughts on the problem/solutions would be helpful.

Ok so I test it and it works now. Thank you! I'm so stupid I didn't check
that I was importing the legacy one and not the maven api one!!!
By the way, in maven 3 it seems that this interface is deprecated. How do
you plan to provide this kind of service in the future?

Many thanks,

Romain.

When I run `mvn test`, I sometimes get misleading reports ("all unit tests
pass"), when in fact, upon manually recompiling the code with `mvn compile`
and running `mvn test` again, the new code shows test failures.

Is this normal behavior for a Maven project? How can I force a Maven task
to depend on other Maven tasks?

> It sounds as though you might have intermittent tests.


Good guess, but no. In my case, I had refactored the arity of some
constructors, without updating all the code calling the constructors. On my
machine, `mvn test` showed everything passing. Wasn't until a coworker ran
`mvn test` on her computer that we saw a test failure.

Also, on her computer, `mvn install` failed due to missing generated
sources. Would be nice if I could specify in the pom that the
`generate-sources` task is required before `mvn compile`.

I'd like Maven tasks to work more like Make tasks, so that everything
downstream gets updated based on upstream file changes.

No such thing as a Maven task.
Maven projects produce artifacts which other projects can declare as 
dependencies.
You can have Maven projects that include sub-projects (multi-module 
project).

Can you rephrase your question or describe what you are trying to do.

Bear in mind that Maven is used by tens of thousands of software 
development projects so that if you can describe what you want to do, 
someone will have already done it and can show you how.

I was building a "toy" application that we're using to start work on a prot=
otype for something, and a build failed with an error like the following:

Could not transfer artifact org.ops4j.pax.runner:pax-runner-no-jcl:pom:1.4.=
0 from/to central (http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/): Checksum validation fai=
led, expected e52cedb3dba50c26877a6b3d88a08f98703d82a4 but is 2406c868ae24a=
7f15c78aa362346afd6ba44ec22 -> [Help 1]

This seems like it's saying that the artifact on Maven Central is corrupted=
.  I tried manually downloading this artifact from Maven Central, but the m=
d5 sum (I don't know if the algorithm used above is md5 or something else) =
comes out to neither of those values.

I could use some more background on this, including what I should do to fix=
 this (if I can do anything).

I would like to amend my pom so that the test *phase* depends on the
compile *phase*.

I'm certain that this dependency flow is already the default. It's just
weird to experience a `mvn test` passing when a manual `mvn compile`
produces compile errors.

No need to specify. Any plugins bound to generate-sources will run =
before the compile phase. Are you using custom plugins? Multiple =
modules?

Maybe show us your pom?

It's the sha1 checksum. The file pax-runner-no-jcl-1.4.0.pom.sha1 says the
checksum is e52cedb3dba50c26877a6b3d88a08f98703d82a4. This could be wrong.
There are several newer versions, try one of them and see if they have
correct metadata.

You could also configure Maven to ignore checksum errors. That is the
default, so I assume you have reconfigured that?

Ah, the pom.  I was checking the jar.

How do I tell what checksum is expected?  Can I see that on MavenCentral (h=
ttp://search.maven.org)?

You're suggesting I turn off checksum validation for artifacts downloaded f=
rom the public internet? :)

Yes, we have checksum validation on.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

I've tried adding thrift / gen-java namespaces and directories to
<excludes> configuration for maven-javadoc-plugin, but when I run `mvn
javadoc:javadoc`, it still attempts to create javadocs for my generated
Thrift Java classes.

Can someone provide a full pom.xml example for how to do this properly?

David,

you should open a bug for this on issues.sonatype.org. They will fix the
checksums.

Subject: Database generation in separate module

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

Hi all,

I have a project which consists of several modules:

pom.xml
  |
   --- module1
  |       src/...
  |       pom.xml
  |
   --- module2
  |       src/...
  |       pom.xml
  |
   --- database
          src/.../liquibase.xml
          pom.xml

My Liquibase changelogs are all in the database module under the
src/main/resources directory.
The database module executes the liquibase:update during the
process-resources stage, this works great.
During a normal run It uses a H2 database which it creates in the target
directory of its own module (database/target/dbfile).
The packaging of this module is simply pom, and I plan on configuring an
assembly which creates a ZIP file containing everything needed for setting
up and updating a database.

Now my problem is that when I want to test one of my other modules against
a database, I want to use a H2 database which was created by Liquibase.
How can I get the Liquibase generated H2 database from the target folder of
the database module into the target directory of module 1 or/and 2? Or are
there any other mechanisms I could use?

I prefer not to generate the H2 database in something else than the target
directories when I don't have to.
I want the Maven projects to be self-contained and not rely on some other
directory or the users settings.xml.

Thank you in advance.

Melvyn

Ah, the various online tutorials for this failed to specify which XML
element the plugin configuration should be nested under. This works for me:

...
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <!-- Exclude javadocs for Thrift -->
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-javadoc-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>2.9.1</version>
        <configuration>
          <excludePackageNames>*thrift*</excludePackageNames>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
...

Are you generating any reports using the spotfire plugin and/or perhaps
generating code coverage reports? Those have helped me identify whats going
on in the past. What you describe sounds like a dependency issue within
your modules. As others have mentioned, seeing a POM or some output would
help. Beyond that it is very difficult to speculate on what is going on.
Personally, I would try putting everything into an aggregator project and
see what happens. Perhaps run install instead of compile so update
compilation units are installed in your local repo. Those are the things I
would do.

Hi Benson,

> The above does not exclude src/main/resources/log4j.properties.

Does checkstyle actually consider the resources folder? If you specify only
**/log4j.properties does it work? Either way, sounds like JIRA time.

The Apache Maven team is pleased to announce the release of the Apache  
Maven Release Plugin, version 2.4.2

This plugin is used to release a project with Maven, saving a lot of  
repetitive, manual work. Releasing a project is made in two steps: prepare  
and perform.

http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-release-plugin/

You should specify the version in your project's plugin configuration:

<plugin>
   <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
   <artifactId>maven-release-plugin</artifactId>
   <version>2.4.2</version>
</plugin>

Release Notes - Maven Release Plugin - Version 2.4.2

** Bug
     * [MRELEASE-766] - release:prepare stores settings.xml in a public  
directory
     * [MRELEASE-832] - When performing a release, username and password  
parameters are ignored.
     * [MRELEASE-846] - m2 release plugin exposes SCM password in  
release.properties file


Enjoy,

-The Apache Maven team
